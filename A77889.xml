            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Bulk and Price of the two Volumes of the Hiſtory of our Reformation which I have publiſhed, being ſuch, that every one cannot find the Mony to buy them, or the Leiſure to read them, I have been deſired by many to contract what I proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted more largly in that Work, and bring it into a leſs Compaſs.</p>
            <p>I know Abridgments are generally hurtful: In them Men receive ſuch a ſlight Tincture of Knowledge, as only feeds Vanity, and furniſhes Diſcourſe, but does not give ſo clear a View of things, nor ſo ſolid an Inſtruction as may be bad in more copious Writings. And as it is a grievous Impoſition on that time which ought to be imploied to better uſes, to draw out that which might be expreſſed in few words, to ſuch a length, that it frights ſome from the ſtudy of
<pb facs="tcp:170737:3"/>Books, which might have been of excellent uſe, if they had not been too Voluminous; and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the Patience of thoſe who are reſolved to acquire Knowledge in the moſt labourious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods; ſo it is on the other hand a great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Improvement of Learning, when things are too much contracted, and ſuch hints are only given, as may be the Seeds of excellent Notions, perhaps in very rich and fruitful Minds: for copious Enlargements are often ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make the greateſt part who are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſlow and heavy in their Apprehenſions, enter into thoſe Notions which we ſet before them. It is a true Judgment of Men and Things, that muſt direct us to ſeek and keep that Mean betwixt thoſe Extreams that may be of the greateſt Advantage to the World.</p>
            <p>What is ſaid of Notions and Matters of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is likewiſe applicable to Matters of Fact. Hiſtory is of little uſe, if we conſider it only as a Tale of what was tranſacted in former times. Then it becomes moſt profitable, when the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Reaſons of Affairs, and ſecret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Ends, together with the true Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters of Eminent Men, are rightly preſented to us, that ſo upon the light which is given us of paſt times, we may form Prudent Judgments of the preſent time, and probable Conjectures of what is to come; and may frame ſuch a true Idea of Men and Parties, as may both enlighten our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings more by giving us a freer Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Humane Affairs, and may better direct us in our conduct.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170737:3"/>
            <p>This made me judge it neceſſary to open things in my Hiſtory as largely as my Materials could ſerve me: and becauſe I writ upon a ſubject that had been much contradicted, I was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only to add a great Collection of Records for my Juſtification, which makes the half of each Volume, but likewiſe in the Hiſtory it ſelf, to give often an account of the grounds on which I went. I alſo added an Appendix, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more remarkable Calumnies, by which the Writers of the Roman Communion have endeavoured to corrupt the Hiſtory of that time; together with a Confutation of them. I was likewiſe careful to ſet down many particular Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities relating to the Proceedings of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the Importance of which, every Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will not be aware at firſt. I gave alſo a large account of all the Arguments that prevailed with the Divines, as well as the Reaſons that wrought on States-men, in the changes that were made; in which the Reader may find an Apology for the Reformation, interwoven with its Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>In all theſe particulars, there was matter enough for an Abridger to cut off a great deal, and yet to give ſuch an account of the whole Tranſaction, as might in a great meaſure ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy even Inquiſitive Perſons. I underſtood that another was about this, which made me reſolve on doing it my ſelf; for none can ſo truly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and by conſequence abridge any Book as the Author himſelf; who, as he knows his own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſt; ſo he who has fixed his Thoughts long
<pb facs="tcp:170737:4"/>upon my Argument, will be beſt able to judge what are the things and Circumſtances that are of the greateſt Importance, and are moſt neceſſary to be rightly underſtood. In compiling this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment, I have wholly waved every thing that belonged to the Records, and the Proof of what I relate, or to the Confutation of the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods that run through the Popiſh Hiſtorians. All that is to be found in the Hiſtory at large; and therefore in this Abridgment every thing is to be taken upon truſt, and thoſe that deſire a fuller Satisfaction, are to ſeek it in the Volums which I have already publiſhed. The Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities relating to the Proceedings of both Houſes oſ Parliament could not be brought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſo ſhort an Abſtract. Many Digreſſions and the Deductions of Arguments, are either paſt over, or but ſhortly touched. He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be particularly informed in any or all of theſe, muſt reſort to the Hiſtory it ſelf.</p>
            <p>All that I pretend to have done in this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment is, that I have given a true and clear account of the Progreſs of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in all thoſe Windings, and Advances, and Declinings, through which it was carried from its firſt beginnings, till it was brought to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſetlement under Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> and this is done in ſuch a manner, that I hope the Reader ſhall not find much cauſe to complain that the endeavouring to be ſhort has made me either obſcure or defective. In the Prefaces to the two Volumes I endeavoured to clear the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers mind of the Prejudices which may be apt to
<pb facs="tcp:170737:4"/>ariſe, either from a ſlight and general View of this matter, or from the falſe Relations that have been formerly made of it. I ſhall not undertake to abridge them, for I brought them there into as narrow a compaſs as the weight of the matter did admit of: Therefore I refer the Reader that Labours under the ill Effects of ſuch Impreſſions to the Prefaces themſelves; and I ſhall add here that which is the laſt part of the Preface to the ſecond Volume, becauſe it may be of more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe, and is accommodated to all, that as may be ſuppoſed, will have the curioſity to read this Abridgment, that ſo they may come to it with a true Idea of the Nature of Religion in general and of the Chriſtian Religion in particular.</p>
            <p>That Religion is chiefly deſigned for perfecting the nature of Man, for improving his Faculties, governing his Actions, and ſecuring the Peace of every mans Conſcience, and of the Societies of Mankind in common, is a truth ſo plain, that without further arguing about it all will agree to it. Every part of Religion is then to be judged by its Relation to the main ends of it; And ſince the Chriſtian Doctrine was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Heaven, as the moſt perfect and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per way that ever was, for the advancing the good of Mankind, nothing can be a part of this holy Faith but what is proportioned to the end for which it was deſigned. And all the Additions that have been made to it, ſince it was firſt delivered to the World, are juſtly to be ſuſpected; eſpecially where it is manifeſt at firſt View, that they were intended to ſerve
<pb facs="tcp:170737:5"/>carnal and ſecular ends. What can be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſuppoſed in the Papacy, where the Popes are choſen by ſuch Intrigues, either of the two Crowns, the Nephews of the former Pope, or the craft of ſome aſpiring Men, to entitle them to Infallability or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction? What can we think of redeeming Souls out of Purgatory, or preſerving them from it by tricks, or ſome mean Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but that it is a foul peice of Merchandiſe? What is to be ſaid of Implicit Obedience, the Prieſtly Dominion over Conſciences, the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures out of the Peoples hands, and the Worſhip of God in a ſtrange Tongue? but that theſe are ſo many Arts to hoodwink the World, and to deliver it up into the hands of the ambitious Clergy. What can we think of Superſtition and Idolatry of Images, and all the other pomp of the <hi>Roman</hi> Worſhip? but that by theſe things the people were to be kept up in a groſs notion of Religion, as a ſplendid buſineſs, and that the Prieſts have a trick of ſaving them, if they will but take care to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour them, and leave that matter wholly in their hands. And to ſum up all, What can we think of that Conſtellation of Prodigies in the Sacrament of the Altar, as they pretend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it, and all really to no purpoſe? but that it is an Art to bring the World by whole ſale to renounce their Reaſon and Senſe, and to have a moſt wonderful Veneration for a ſort of Men who can with a Word perform the moſt aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing that ever was.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170737:5"/>
            <p>I ſhould grow too large for a Preface, if I would purſue this Argument as far as it will go. But if on the other hand we reflect on the true ends of this holy Religion, we muſt needs be convinced that we need go no where elſe out of this Church to find them; and that we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly inſtructed in all parts of it, and furniſhed with all the helps to advance us to that which is indeed <hi>the End of our Faith, the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Souls.</hi> Here we have the Rule of holy Obedience, and the Methods of Repentance and Reconciliation for paſt ſins clearly ſet before us. We believe all that Doctrine which Chriſt and his Apoſtles delivered, and the Primitive Church received: We have the comfort of all thoſe Sacraments which Chriſt inſtituted, and in the ſame manner that he appointed them: All the helps to Devotion that the Goſpel offers are in every ones hand. So what can it be that ſhould ſo extravagantly ſeduce any who have been bred up in a Church ſo well conſtituted? unleſs a blind Superſtition in their temper, or a deſire to get Heaven in ſome eaſier Method than Chriſt has appointed, do ſtrangely impoſe on their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings, or corrupt their minds. Indeed the thing is ſo unaccountable, that it looks like a Curſe from Heaven on thoſe who are given up to it, for their other ſins; for an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Meaſure of Infatuation cannot carry any one fo far in Folly. And it may be laid down for a certain <hi>Maxim,</hi> that ſuch as leave us, have never had a true and well formed Notion of Religion, or of Chriſtianity in its main and chief Deſign; but take things in
<pb facs="tcp:170737:6"/>parcels, and without examining them ſuffer themſelves to be carried away by ſome prejudices which only darken weaker Judgments.</p>
            <p>But if it is an high and unaccountable Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for any to forſake our Communion, and go over to thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is at the ſame time an unexcuſable weakneſs in others who ſeem full of zeal againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and yet upon ſome inconſiderable Objections do depart from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Body, and form ſeparated Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and Communions; though they cannot object any thing material either to our Doctrine or Worſhip: But the moſt aſtoniſhing part of the wonder is, that in ſuch differences there ſhould be ſo little mutual forbearance or gentleneſs to be found: and that they ſhould raiſe ſuch heats as if the ſubſtance of Religion were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them. This is of God, and is a ſtroke from Heaven on both ſides, for their other ſins: We of the Church Communion have truſted too much to the ſupports we receive from the Law, we have done our Duties too ſlightly, and have minded the Care of Souls too little; therefore God to puniſh and awaken us has ſuffered ſo many of our people to be wreſted out of our hands: and thoſe of the Separation have been too forward to Blood and War, and thereby have drawn much guilt on themſelves, and have been too compliant with the Leaders of their ſeveral Factions, or rather apt to out-run them. It is plain, God is offended with us all, and therefore we are puniſhed with this fatal blindneſs, not to ſee at this time the things that belong to our peace.</p>

            <p>And this leads me to Reflections of another ſort, with which I ſhall conclude this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is apparent the Wrath of God hangs over our Heads, and is ready to break out upon us. The Symptoms of our ill Condition are as ſad as they are viſible: and one of the worſt is, that each ſort and Party is very ready to throw the guilt of it off themſelves, and caſt it on others, with whom they are diſpleaſed: But no Man ſays, <hi>What have I done?</hi> The Clergy accuſe the Laity, and the Country complains of the City: every one finds out ſomewhat wherein he thinks he is leaſt concerned, and is willing to fix on <hi>that</hi> all the Indignation of Heaven, which, God knows, we our ſelves have kindled againſt our ſelves. It cannot be denied, ſince it is ſo viſible, that univerſally the whole Nation is corrupted, and that the Goſpel has not had thoſe effects among us which might have been expected, after ſo long and ſo free a courſe as it has had in this <hi>Iſland.</hi> Our wiſe and worthy Progenitors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed our Doctrine and Worſhip; but we have not reformed our Lives and Manners: what will it avail us to underſtand the right Methods of worſhiping God, if we are without true Devotion, and coldly perform publick Offices, without ſenſe and affection, which is as bad as a <hi>Bead-roll</hi> of Prayers in whatſoever Language they are pronounced. What ſignifies our having the Sacraments purely adminiſtred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, if we either contemptuouſly neglect
<pb facs="tcp:170737:7"/>them, or irreverently handle them, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in compliance with Law, than out of a ſenſe of the Holy Duties incumbent on us? for what end are the Scriptures put in our hands, if we do not read them with great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and order our lives according to them? and what does all preaching ſignify, if Men go to Church meerly for Form, and hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons only as ſet Diſcourſes, which they will cenſure or commend as they think they ſee cauſe, but are reſolved never to be the better for them? If to all theſe ſad Conſiderations we add the groſs Senſuality and Impurity, that is ſo avowedly practiſed that it is become a faſhion, ſo far it is from being a reproach; the Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Injuſtice, Intemperance, and many other Immoralities among us, what can be expected, but that theſe Abominations receiving the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Aggravation they are capable of, from the clear Light of the Goſpel which we have ſo long enjoyed, the juſt Judgments of Heaven, ſhould fall on us ſo ſignally, as to make us a reproach to all our Neighbours. But as if all this were not enough, to fill up the meaſure of our Iniquities, many have arriv'd at a new pitch of Impiety, by defying Heaven it ſelf, with their avowed Blaſphemies and Atheiſm: and if they are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of their Atheiſtical Tenets, which are indeed the moſt ridiculous of any in the World, they ſet up their reſt on ſome general Notions of Morality and Natural Religion, and do boldly reject all that is revealed: and where they dare vent it, (alas! where dare they not do it?) they reject Chriſtianity and the Scriptures, with open
<pb facs="tcp:170737:7"/>and impudent ſcorn, and are abſolutely inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of any Obligation of Conſcience in any thing whatſoever: and even in that Morality, which they for Decencies ſake magnify ſo much, none are more bare-facedly and groſly faulty. This is a direct Attempt againſt God himſelf, and can we think that he will not viſit for ſuch things, nor be avenged on ſuch a Nation? And yet the Hypocriſy of thoſe who diſguiſe their flagitious Lives, with a Mask of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is perhaps a Degree above all, though not ſo ſcandalous till the Mask falls off, and that they appear to be what they truly are. When we are all ſo guilty, and when we are ſo alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the black Clouds that threaten ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and laſting Storms, what may be expected but that we ſhould be generally ſtruck with a deep ſenſe of our crying Sins, and turn to God with our whole Souls? But if after all the loud A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakenings from Heaven we will not hearken to that Voice, but will ſtill go on in our Sins, we may juſtly look for unheard of Calamities, and ſuch Miſeries as ſhall be proportioned to our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; and then we are ſure they will be great and wonderful.</p>
            <p>Yet if on the other hand there were a general turning to God, or at leaſt if ſo many were right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of this, as, according to the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Mercies of God allow, did ſome way ballance the Wickedneſs of the reſt, and if theſe were as zealous in the true Methods of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring God's Favour, as others are in procuring his Diſpleaſure; and were not only mourning for their own Sins, but for the Sins of others; the
<pb facs="tcp:170737:8"/>Prayers and Sighs of many ſuch, might diſſipate that diſmal Cloud which our ſins have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and we might yet hope to ſee the Goſpel take root among us: ſince <hi>that</hi> God who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it is merciful, and full of Compaſſion, and ready to forgive; and this holy Religion which by his Grace is planted among us, is ſtill ſo dear to him, that if we by our own unworthineſs do not render our ſelves incapable of ſo great a Bleſſing, we may reaſonably hope that he will continue that which at firſt was by ſo many happy concurring Providences brought in, and was by a continued <hi>Series</hi> of the ſame indulgent care advanc'd dy Degrees, and at laſt raiſed to that pitch of perfection which few things atttain in this World.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170737:17"/>great joy received <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh;
<note place="margin">Book I.</note>who being himſelf deſcended from the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> by his marriage with the Heir of the Houſe of York, did deliver them from the fear of any more Wars by new Pretenders. But the covetouſneſs of his Temper, the ſeverity of his Miniſters, his ill conduct in the Matter of <hi>Britaign,</hi> and his jealouſy of the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> not only gave occaſion to Impoſtors to diſturb his Reign, but to ſeveral Inſurrections that were raiſed in his time: By all which he was become ſo generally odious to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that as his Son might have raiſed a dangerous competition for the Crown du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Life, as devolved on him by his Mother's death, who was indeed the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Heir; ſo his death was little lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<note place="margin">

And when Miniſters, by the King's Orders, were condemned and executed for invading the Liberties of the People under the Covert
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170737:17"/>of the King's Prerogative; it made the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conclude, that they ſhould hereafter live ſecure, under the Protection of ſuch a Prince, and that the violent Remedies of Parliamentary Judgments ſhould be no more neceſſary, except as in this caſe, to confirm what had been done before in the ordinary Courts of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>The King alſo either from the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of his own Temper,
<note place="margin">He is very liberal.</note> or the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had made of the ill Effects of his Father's Parſimony, did diſtribute his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Largeſſes with an unmeaſured Bounty; ſo that he quickly emptied his Treaſure,
<note place="margin">1800000 <hi>l</hi>
                  </note> which his Father had left the fulleſt in Chriſtendom: But till the ill Effects of this appeared, it raiſed in his Court and Subjects the greateſt Hopes poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a Prince, whoſe firſt Actions ſhewed an equal mixture of Juſtice and Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
               <p>At his firſt coming to the Crown, the Succeſſes of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelth, in <hi>Italy,</hi> made him engage as a Party in the Wars with the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the Wars.</note> He went in Perſon beyond Sea, and took both <hi>Terwin</hi> and <hi>Tournay;</hi> in which,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1513"/> as he acquired the Reputation of a good and fortunate Captain; ſo <hi>Maximil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> the Emperor, put an unuſual Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on him, for he took his pay, and rid in his Troops.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1514"/> But a Peace quickly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; upon which, the <hi>French</hi> King mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Younger Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> but he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoon after, <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt ſucceeded: and he renewing his Pretenſions upon <hi>Italy,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170737:18"/>Henry</hi> could not be prevailed on to ingage early in the War, till the Succeſſes of either Party ſhould diſcover which of the ſides was the weaker, and needed his Aſſiſtance moſt.</p>
               <p>But tho hitherto, <hi>Spain</hi> was an unequal Match to <hi>France,</hi> yet all <hi>Spain</hi> being now united (except <hi>Portugal</hi>) and ſtrengthned by the Acceſſion of the Dominions of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> and inriched by the diſcovery of the <hi>Indies;</hi> and all this falling into the hands of ſo great a Prince as <hi>Charles,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the fifth Emperor of that Name; the ballance between theſe Kingdoms grew as equal, as the Qualities of the Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were, which ingaged them in a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry that made their Minds as divided, as their Intereſts were oppoſite. <hi>Charles</hi> being preferred to <hi>Francis</hi> in the Competition for the Empire, that kindled the Animoſity higher, and ſeemed to encreaſe <hi>Charles</hi>'s Party, tho the extent and diſtance of his Dominion was ſuch, that one Soul (tho his was one of the largeſt and moſt active in the World) could not animate ſo vaſt a Body.
<note place="margin">He is courted both by <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note> Both theſe Princes ſaw how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable an Ally or Enemy <hi>England</hi> might prove, under a King ſo much eſteemed and beloved; ſo they ſpared no Arts that might engage him into their Intereſts; they gained his Miniſters by their Preſents, and himſelf by their Complements, for it was ſoon found out, that Vanity was his weak ſide.
<note place="margin">May 1520,</note> The Emperour came in Perſon to <hi>England,</hi> without the diſtruſtful Precaution
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170737:18"/>of a Paſsport, and did ſo prevail with him, and his great Favourite Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> by the promiſe of the Popedom, that tho an Interview followed between <hi>Francis</hi> and him,

Both publick and private Intereſts wrought on the King; and his own Reſentments, as well as the Cardinals animated him to it: for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was ſo lifted up with his Succeſs, that he began to form the Project of an Univerſal Empire, and tho he had come to <hi>England</hi> in Perſon a ſecond time,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1522"/> and had contracted a Marriage with the King's Daughter, yet he preferred a Match with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> to it, judging it to be of more Importance to him to keep all quiet in <hi>Spain.</hi>

                  <hi>Francis</hi> was now at liberty, but had given his Sons as Hoſtages, ſo he was ſlow in his Proceedings, tho he was the Perſon moſt concerned in the League: The Emperour was highly diſpleaſed with the Pope, whom he look'd on as his own Creature, but it was always obſerved, that of what Faction ſoever a Cardinal might be, yet upon the Advancement, he became the Head of his own.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170737:19"/>Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> that upon a Diſcontent given him in <hi>France,</hi> had gone over to the Emperour's Service, came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and took it by ſtorm, himſelf being killed in the Aſſault, the Pope and ſeventeen Cardinals,

The Emperour prevented the Conjunction he ſaw like to follow, and having brought the Pope to his own Terms, he reſtored him again to his Freedom. And thus both the Pope and the King of <hi>France,</hi> that by very unuſuſal Accidents had been taken Priſoners, acknowledged that their Liberty was chiefly due to the Indeavours that King <hi>Henry</hi> had uſed for procuring it.</p>

<note place="margin">Factions in the Council.</note> headed by the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and the Lord Treaſurer that was Duke of <hi>Norfolk:</hi> The former much complained of the Conſumption of the Treaſure; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſtified himſelf, that he only obeyed the King's Orders. But the Treaſurer's Party, under a bountiful King, muſt always be ſtrongeſt, both in the Court and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. In the firſt Parliament, the Juſtice done upon <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudly,</hi> gave ſo great Satisfaction, that all things went as the Court deſired. In the ſecond Parliament, a Brief that Pope <hi>Julius</hi> writ, complaining of <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, was firſt read in the Houſe of Lords, and then carried down by the L. Chancellor, and ſome other Lords to the Houſe of Commons, and read there, upon which, Mony was granted for a War with <hi>France.</hi> At this time, <hi>Fox,</hi> to ſupport his Party againſt the Lord Treaſurer, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to bring <hi>Thomas Wolſey</hi> into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
<note place="margin">Car. <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fey</hi>'s Riſe.</note> he was of mean Extraction, but had great Parts, and a wonderful Dexterity in inſinuating himſelf into Men's Favours; ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170737:20"/>he being brought into Buſineſs, did ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the King, that he became very quickly the Maſter of his Spirit, and of all his Affairs; and for fifteen Years continued to be the moſt abſolute Favourite that had ever been ſeen in <hi>England.</hi> He ſaw the King was much ſet on his Pleaſures, and had a great Averſion to buſineſs; and the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours being unwilling to bear the load of Affairs, were uneaſy to him, by preſſing him to govern by his own Counſels; but he knew the methods of Favourites better, and ſo was not only eaſy, but aſſiſtant to the King in his Pleaſures, and undertook to free him from the Trouble of Government, and to give him leiſure to follow his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.</p>
               <p>He was Maſter of all the Offices at home,
<note place="margin">And Greatneſs.</note> and Treaties abroad; ſo that all Affairs went as he directed them. He it ſeems became ſoon obnoxious to Parliaments, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tried but one during his Miniſtry, where the Supply was granted ſo ſcantily, that afterwards he chuſed rather to raiſe Mony by Loans and Benevolences, than by the free gift of the People in Parliament. He became ſo ſcandalous for his ill Life, that he grew to be a Diſgrace to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; for he not only ſerved the King, but alſo ſhared with him in his Pleaſures, which were unhappy to him, for he was ſpoiled with Venerial Diſtempers. He was firſt made Biſhop of <hi>Tournay</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> then of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> after that he was promoted to the See of <hi>York,</hi> and had both the Abby
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170737:21"/>of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells in Commendam;</hi> the laſt he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards exchanged for <hi>Dureſm,</hi> and upon <hi>Foxes</hi> death, he quitted <hi>Dureſm,</hi> that he might take <hi>Wincheſter;</hi> and beſides all this, the King by a ſpecial Grant, gave him power to diſpoſe of all the Eccleſiaſtical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments in <hi>England,</hi> ſo that in effect he was the Pope of this other World, as was ſaid an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently of an Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and no doubt but he copied skilfully enough after thoſe Patterns that were ſet him at <hi>Rome.</hi> Being made a Cardinal, and ſetting up a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatine Court, he found it fit for his Ambition to have the Great Seal likewiſe, that there might be no claſhing between thoſe two Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions. He had in one word all the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities neceſſary for a Great Miniſter, and all the Vices ordinary in a Great Favourite.</p>
               <p>During this whole Raign, the Duke's of <hi>Norfolk</hi> Father and Son, were Treaſurers, but that long and ſtrange courſe of Favour in ſo tickliſh a Time, turn'd fatally upon the Son, near the end of the King's Life.

<note place="margin">

The ſtrength of his Body, and the gracefulneſs of his Perſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed more to his Riſe, than his Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Affairs, or the Endowments of his Mind, for the greateſt Evidence he gave of his Underſtanding, was, that knowing he was not made for Buſineſs, he did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170737:21"/>to it; a Temper ſeldom obſerved by the Creatures of Favour. The frame and ſtrength of his Body made him a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the Diverſions of that Age, Juſts and Tiltings, and a fit Match for the King, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Second to him, who delighted mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them. His Perſon was ſo acceptable to the Ladies, that the King's Siſter, the Queen Dowager of <hi>France</hi> liked him, and by a ſtrange ſort of making Love, prefixed him a time for gaining her Conſent to marry him; and aſſured him, if that he did not prevail within that time, he might for ever deſpair. She married him in <hi>France,</hi> and the King af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhew of ſome Diſpleaſure, was pacified and continued his Favours to him, not only during his Siſter's Life, but to the laſt, and in all the Revolutions of the Court that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, in which every Miniſter fell by turns, he ſtill enjoyed his ſhare in the King's Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Affection: ſo much happier it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be loved, than truſted by him.</p>
               <p>The King denied himſelf none of thoſe Pleaſures, that are as much legitimated in Courts, as they are condemned elſewhere; but yet he declared no Miſtrisſ, but <hi>Elizabeth Blunt,</hi> and owned no Iſſue, but a Son he had by her, whom he afterwards made Duke of <hi>Richmond.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King's uſage of his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> He took great care never to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil himſelf with his Parliaments, and he met with no Oppoſition in any, except in that one, which was during Cardinal <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi>'s Miniſtry; in which 800000 <hi>l.</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for a War with <hi>France,</hi> to be paid in four Years, the debate about it roſe very
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170737:22"/>high, and not above the half of it was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; ſo the Cardinal came into the Houſe of Commons, and deſired to hear the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of thoſe who were againſt the Supply, but he was told that it was againſt their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to ſpeak to a Debate before any that was not of the Houſe: he was much diſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at this, and caſt the blame of it upon Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> that was Speaker, and after that he found out other means of ſupplying the King without Parliaments.</p>
               <p>The King had been educated with more than ordinary Care:
<note place="margin">The King's Education.</note> and Learning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in its dawning, after a night of long and groſs Ignorance, his Father had given Orders that both his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and he ſhould be well inſtructed in matters of Knowledg; not with any deſign to make him Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for he had made ſmall progreſs, when his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> died, being then but eleven Years old: perhaps <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh felt the Prejudices of his own Education ſo much, that he was more careful to have his Son better taught; or may be he did it to amuze him, and keep him from looking too early into matters of State. The Learning then moſt in credit among the Clergy, was the Scholaſtical Divinity, which by a ſhew of Subtilty, did recommend it ſelf to curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons; and being very ſutable to a vain and contentious Temper, was that which agreed beſt with his Diſpoſition; and it being likely to draw the moſt Flattery from Divines, became the chief Subject of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170737:22"/>his Studies, in which he grew not only to be Eminent for a Prince, whoſe Knowledg tho ever ſo moderate, will be admired by Flatterers as a Prodigy, but he might real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have paſt for a Learned Man had his Quality been ever ſo mean. He delighted in the purity of the Latin Tongue, and underſtood Philoſophy, and was ſo great a Maſter in Muſick, that he compoſed well. He was a bountiful Patron to all Learned Men, more particularly to <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and <hi>Polidore Virgil,</hi> and delighted much in thoſe Returns which hungry Scholars uſe to make to liberal Princes; for he loved Flattery out of meaſure,
<note place="margin">His Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Vanity.</note> and particularly to be extolled for his Learning and great Underſtanding: and he had enough of it to have ſurfeited a Man of any Modeſty; for all the World, both at home and abroad, contended who ſhould exceed moſt indecently in ſetting out his Praiſes. The Clergy carried it; for as he had merited moſt at their hands, both by his eſpouſing the Intereſts of the Papacy, and by his entering the Liſts with <hi>Luther:</hi> ſo thoſe that hoped to be advanced by thoſe Arts, were as little aſhamed in magnifying him out of meaſure, as he was in receiving their groſs Commendations.</p>
               <p>The manner of promotion to Biſhopricks and Abbies was then the ſame,
<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the promotion of Biſhops.</note> that had taken place ever ſince the Inveſtitures by the Ring and Staff were taken out of the hands of Princes. Upon a Vacancy the King ſeized on all the Temporalities, and granted a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence for an Election, with a ſpecial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170737:23"/>of the Perſon; which being returned, the Royal Aſſent was given, and it was ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> that Bulls might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded, and then the Biſhop Elect was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated: after that he came to the King and renounced every Clauſe in his Bulls that was contrary to the King's Prerogative, or to the Law, and ſwore Fealty; and then were the Temporalities reſtored. Nor could Bulls be ſued out at <hi>Rome</hi> without a Licence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great Seal; ſo that the Kings of <hi>Engl.</hi> had reſerved the power to themſelves, of promoting to Eccleſiaſtical Benefices not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Invaſions the Popes had made on the Temporal power of Princes.
<note place="margin">A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Immunity.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Immunity of Church-men for crimes committed by them, till they were firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded by the Spirituality, occaſioned the only Conteſt that was in the beginning of this Reign between the Secular and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Courts. King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh paſt a Law, that Clerks convict ſhould be burnt in the hand. A temporary Law was alſo made in the beginning of this Reign, That Murderers and Robbers, not being Biſhops, Prieſts, nor Deacons, ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the benefit of Clergy: but this was to laſt only till the next Parliament, and ſo being not continued by it,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1515"/> the Act deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. The Abbot of <hi>Winchelcomb</hi> preached ſeverely againſt it, as being contrary to the Laws of God, and the Liberties of the Holy Church, and ſaid, that all who aſſented to it had faln under the Cenſures of the Church. And afterwards he publiſhed a Book, to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170737:23"/>prove that all Clerks, even of the lower Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, were Sacred, and could not be judged by the Temporal Courts. This being done in Parliament-time, the Temporal Lords, with the Commons, addreſſed to the King, deſiring him to repreſs the Inſolence of the Clergy. So a publick Hearing was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the King, and all the Judges: Dr. <hi>Standiſh,</hi> a Franciſcan, argued againſt the Immunity, and proved that the judging Clerks had been in all times practiſed in <hi>England;</hi> and that it was neceſſary for the peace and ſafety of Mankind, that all Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals ſhould be puniſhed. The Abbot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued on the other ſide, and ſaid, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a Decree of the Church, and was a Sin in it ſelf. <hi>Standiſh</hi> anſwered, That all Decrees were not obſerved: for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Decrees for Reſidence, Biſhops did not reſide at their Cathedrals. And ſince no Decree did bind till it was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this concerning Immunity, which was never received in <hi>England,</hi> did not bind. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had fully argued the matter, the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were all of opinion that the Fryar was too hard for the Abbot, and ſo moved the King that the Biſhops might be ordered to make him preach a Recantation Sermon. But they refuſed to do it, and ſaid they were bound by their Oaths to maintain his Opinion. <hi>Standiſh</hi> was upon this, much hated by the Clergy, but the matter was let fall, yet the Clergy carried the point, for the Law was not continued.</p>
               <p>Not long after this, an Accident fell out
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170737:24"/>that drew great Conſequences after it. One <hi>Richard Hun,</hi> a Merchant in <hi>London,</hi> was ſued by his Pariſh-Prieſt for a Mortua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Legates Court, ſo he was adviſed to ſue the Prieſt in the temporal Court for a Premunire for bringing the King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects before a forraign and illegal Court. This incenſed the Clergy ſo much that they contrived his Deſtruction: So hearing that he had <hi>Wickclif</hi>'s Bible, he was upon that put in the Biſhop's Priſon for Hereſy,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hunn</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy.</note> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined upon ſundry Articles, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſome things, and ſubmitted himſelf to Mercy, upon which they ought according to Law, to have injoyned him Penance, and diſcharged him, this being his firſt Crime; but he could not be prevailed on by the terror of this to let his Suit fall in the Temporal Court;
<note place="margin">Murdered.</note> ſo one Night his Neck was broken with an Iron Chain, and he was wounded in other Parts of his Body, and then knit up in his own Girdle, and it was given out that he had hanged himſelf; but the Coroners Inqueſt by examining the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and by ſeveral other Evidences, and particularly by the confeſſion of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, gave their Verdict, that he was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Biſhop's Chancellor Dr. <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> and the Sumner, and the Bel-ringer. The Spiritual Court proceeded againſt the dead Body, and charged <hi>Hun</hi> with all the Hereſy in <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Preface to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<note place="margin">And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, his Body burnt.</note> becauſe that was found in his Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo he was condemned as an Heretick, and upon that his Body was burnt. The
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170737:24"/>Biſhops of <hi>Dureſm</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and many Doctors ſitting with the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> when he gave Judgment; ſo that it was looked upon as an Act of the whole Clergy: but this produced very ill Effects; for the Clergy loſt the Affections of the City to ſuch a degree, that they could never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them; nor did any one thing diſpoſe them more than this did, to the entertaining the new Preachers, and to every thing that tended to the reproach of the Church-men, whom they eſteemed no more their Paſtors, but accounted them barbarous Murderers. The Rage went ſo high, that the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> complained, that he was not ſafe in his own Houſe, and there were many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings before the Council; for the Cardinal did all he could to ſtop the progreſs of the Matter, but in vain: for the Biſhop's Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and the Sumner were indicted as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals in the Murder. In Parliament an Act paſſed reſtoring <hi>Hun</hi>'s Children; but the Commons ſent up a Bill concerning his Murder; yet that was laid aſide by the Lords, where the Clergy were the Majority. The Clergy look'd on the Oppoſition that <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> had made in the point of their.
<note place="margin">Further Diſputes about Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.</note> Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as that which gave the riſe to <hi>Hun</hi>'s firſt Suit; ſo the Convocation cited him to anſwer for his Carriage in that Matter; but he claimed the King's Protection, ſince he had done nothing, but only pleaded in the King's Name. The Clergy pretended they did not proſecute him for his pleading, but for ſome of his Divinity Lectures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170737:25"/>to the Liberty of the Church, which the King was bound to maintain by his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation-Oath: but the Temporal Lords, the Judges, and the Commons prayed the King alſo to maintain the Laws according to his Coronation-Oath, and to give <hi>Standiſh</hi> his Protection. The King upon this being in great perplexity, required <hi>Veyſy,</hi> afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> to declare upon his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> the truth in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. His Opinion was againſt the Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo another publick Hearing being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>Standiſh</hi> was accuſed for teaching, <hi>That the Inferiour Orders were not ſacred; That their Exemption was not founded on a Divine Right, but that the Laity might puniſh them; That the Canons of the Church did not bind till they were received; and that the ſtudy of the Canon Law was uſeleſs.</hi> Of theſe he denied ſome, and juſtified other particulars. <hi>Veyſy</hi> being required to give his Opinion, alledged, That the Laws of the Church did only oblige where they were received: As the Law of the Celibate of the Clergy, received in the Weſt, did not bind the Greek Churches, that never received it: So the exemption of the Clerks not being received, did not bind in <hi>England.</hi> The Judges gave their Opinion next, which was, That thoſe who proſecuted <hi>Standiſh</hi> were all in a <hi>Premunire.</hi> So the Court broke up. But in another Hearing, in the preſence of the greateſt part of both Houſes of Parliament, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal ſaid in the name of the Clergy, That tho they intended to do nothing againſt the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170737:25"/>King's Prerogative; yet the trying of Clerks ſeemed to be contrary to the Liberty of the Church, which they were bound by their Oaths to maintain. So they prayed that the matter might be referred to the Pope.</p>
               <p>The King anſwered that he thought <hi>Standiſh</hi> had anſwered them fully: The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> ſaid, he would not ſtand to his Opinion at his Peril. <hi>Standiſh</hi> upon that ſaid, What can one poor Friar do againſt all the Clergy of <hi>England?</hi> The Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſaid, Some of the Fathers of the Church had ſuffered Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom upon that account; but the Chief-Juſtice replied, That many holy Kings had maintained that Law, and many holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had obeyed it. In concluſion the King declared, that he would maintain his Rights, and would not ſubmit them to the Decrees of the Church, otherwiſe than as his Anceſtors had done. <hi>Warham</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> deſired ſo long time might be given, that they might have an Anſwer returned from <hi>Rome;</hi> but that was not granted: yet a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was found. <hi>Horſey</hi> was appointed to be brought to his Trial for <hi>Hun</hi>'s Murder, and upon his pleading not guilty, no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was to be brought, and ſo he was to be diſcharged. But upon this it was ſaid, The Judges were more concerned to maintain their Juriſdiction, than to do Juſtice upon ſo horrid a Murder; ſo the diſcontent given by it was raiſed ſo much higher, and the Crime of a few Murderers, was now transferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole Clergy, who had concerned
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170737:26"/>themſelves ſo much in their Preſervation; and this did very much diſpoſe the Laity to all that was done afterwards, for pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down the Eccleſiaſtical Tyranny.</p>
               <p>This was the only uneaſy ſtop in this King's Raign,
<note place="margin">The King is much addicted to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</note> till the ſuit for his Divorce was commenced. In all other points he was conſtantly in the Pope's Intereſts, who ſent him the common Complements of Roſes, and ſuch other Triffles, by which that See had treated Princes ſo long as Children. The King made the Defence of the Popedom an Article in his Leagues with other Princes, and Pope <hi>Julius</hi> having called a General Council to the <hi>Lateran,</hi> in oppoſition to that which by <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth's means was held at <hi>Piſa;</hi> The King ſent the Biſhops of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> the <hi>Prior</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi>'s and the Abbot of <hi>Winchelcomb</hi> to repreſent the Church of <hi>England,</hi> thereby to give the greater Authority to a pack'd meeting of <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops and Abbots, who aſſumed to themſelves the Title of a <hi>Holy and Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Council.</hi> But no Complement wrought ſo much on the King's Vanity, as the Title of <hi>Defender of Faith,</hi> ſent him by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> upon the Book, which he writ againſt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> concerning the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal drew upon himſelf the hatred of the Clergy,
<note place="margin">Crrdinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> intends to reform the Clergy.</note> by a Bull which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered him to viſit all the Monaſteries of <hi>England;</hi> and to diſpence with all the Laws of the Church for a Year. He alſo gave out, that he intended to reform the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, though he forgot that which ought
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170737:26"/>to be the firſt ſtep of all who pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form others; for none could be worſe than himſelf was. He lived in great Luxury, and in an inſolent Affectation of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Statepoſſible; many of his Domeſticks being men of the firſt Rank. He intended to ſuppreſs many Monaſteries, and thought the beſt way for doing it with the leaſt Scandal, was firſt, to viſit them, and ſo to expoſe their Corruptions: But he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards diverted from this; yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which he laid, being communicated to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> that was then his Secretary, it was put in Practice toward the end of this Reign, when the Monaſteries were all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
               <p>The Convocations were of two ſorts;
<note place="margin">The ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning of Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> ſome were ſummoned by the King, when Parliaments were called, as is in uſe to this Day; only the King did not then prefix a Day, but left that to the Arch-biſhops. Others were called by the Archbiſhops, and were Provincial Synods, of which there were but few. The Cardinal pretended that the ſummoning all Convocations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him, as <hi>Legate;</hi> ſo that when <hi>Warham</hi> had called one, he diſſolved it after it was met, and ſummoned it of new. In that Convocation,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1522"/> a great Supply was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the King, of half a Years Rent of all Benefices payable in five Years, for aſſiſting him in his Wars with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> This was much oppoſed by the Cardinal's Enemies, but it was agreed to at laſt, a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo</hi> being made, that ſuch a heavy tax ſhould
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170737:27"/>never be made a Precedent for the future; tho the Grant they made was more likely to become a Precedent, than this <hi>Proviſo</hi> to be a Security for the time to come.</p>
               <p>This encreaſed the Averſion the Clergy had for the Cardinal: the Monks were more particularly incenſed; for they ſaw he was reſolved to ſuppreſs their Foundations, and convert them to other uſes.</p>
               <p>In the days of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> moſt of the Cathedrals of <hi>England</hi> were poſſeſſed by Secular Prieſts,
<note place="margin">The State of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries.</note> who were generally marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but <hi>Dunſtan</hi> and ſome other Monks took advantage from the Vices of that Prince, to perſwade him to make Compenſation for them; and as he made Laws, in which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared what Compenſations were to be made for Sins, both by the Rich and Poor; ſo, it ſeems, he thought the founding of Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries was the fitteſt Compenſation for a King; and he turned out all the married Prieſts, and put Monks in their ſtead. From that time the Credit and Wealth of Monaſtick Orders continued to encreaſe for ſeveral Ages, till the Begging Orders ſucceeded in the eſteem of the World, to the place which the Monks formerly had; for they decreaſed as much in true worth, as the falſe appearances of it had now raiſed their Revenues. They were not only ignorant themſelves, but very jealous of the progreſs Learning was making: for <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and the other Reſtorers of it, treating them with much ſcorn, they look'd on the encreaſe of it, as that which would much leſſen them, and ſo not only did not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170737:27"/>contribute to it, but rather detracted from it, as that which would make way for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal deſigned two noble Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, the one at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cardinal <hi>Wolſy</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes many.</note> and the other at <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> the place of his Birth, both for the encouragement of the Learned, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Youth; and for that end he procured a Bull for ſuppreſſing divers Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, which being executed, their Lands by Law fell to the King; and thereupon the Cardinal took out Grants of them, and endowed his Colledges with them.</p>
               <p>But we ſhall next conſider the ſtate of Religion in <hi>England.</hi> From the dayes of <hi>Wickliff</hi> there were many that differed from the Doctrines commonly received.
<note place="margin">The growth of <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Doctrine.</note> He writ many Books that gave great Offence to the Clergy, yet being powerfully ſupported by the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> they could not have their revenge during his Life; but he was after his Death condemned, and his Body was raiſed and burnt. The Bible which he tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with the Preface which he ſet before it, produced the greateſt Effects. In it he reflected on the ill Lives of the Clergy, and condemned the Worſhip of Saints and Images, and the corporal Preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament; but the moſt criminal part was, the exhorting all People to read the Scriptures; where the Teſtimonies againſt thoſe Corruptions were ſuch, that there was no way to deal with them but to ſilence them. His Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were not Men of Letters, but being
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170737:28"/>wrought on by the eaſy Conviction of plain Senſe, were by them determined in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions. They did not form themſelves into Body, but were contented to hold their Opinions ſecretly, and did not ſpread them, but to their particular Confidents. The Clergy ſought them out every where, and did deliver them after Conviction to the Secular Arm, that is, to the <hi>Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Primitive Church,
<note place="margin">The Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the Clergy.</note> all cruel Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings upon the account of Hereſy, were condemned; ſo that the Biſhops who accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome Hereticks, upon which they were put to death, were excommunicated for it. Baniſhment and Fines, with ſome Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, were the higheſt Severities even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the greateſt Provocations. But as the Church grew corrupted in other things, ſo a cruel Spirit being generally the mark of all ill Prieſts, of whatſoever Religion they are, they fell under the Influences of it; and from the days of the riſe of the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes,</hi> the ſeverities of the Inquiſition, and Burnings, with many other Cruelties, were by the means of the Dominicans ſet up, firſt in <hi>France,</hi> and then in the other parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> A Decree was alſo made in the Council of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> requiring all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates under the pains of forfeiture and depoſition, to extirpate Hereticks. Burning agreed beſt with their Cruelty, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt terrible ſort of Death, and bearing ſome reſemblance to everlaſting Burnings in Hell; ſo they damned the Souls of the Hereticks, and burnt their Bodies;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170737:28"/>but the Execution of the former part of the Sentence was not in their power, as the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part was. The Canons of that Council being received in <hi>England,</hi> the Proceedings againſt Hereticks grew to be a part of the Common Law, and a Writ for burning them was iſſued out upon their Conviction. But ſpecial Statutes were afterwards made: The firſt under <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond,
<note place="margin">Laws made in <hi>England</hi> againſt Hereticks.</note> was only agreed to by the Lords; and without its being conſented to by the Commons, the King aſſented to it; yet all the Severity in it was no more, than that Writs ſhould go out to the Sheriffs to hold Hereticks in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, till they ſhould be judged by the Laws of the Church. The Preamble of the Law ſays, <q rend="inline">They were very numerous, that they had a peculiar Habit, that they preached in many Churches, &amp; other Places againſt the Faith, and refuſed to ſubmit to the Cenſures of the Church.</q> This was ſent with the other Acts according to the cuſtom of that Time, to all the Sheriffs of <hi>England</hi> to be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them; but the Year following in the next Parliament, the Commons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that that Act was publiſhed, to which they had never conſented; ſo an Act paſſed declaring the former null; yet this was ſuppreſſed, and the former was ſtill eſteemed a good Law.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth came to the Crown, he owing it in great meaſure to the help of the Clergy, paſſed an Act againſt all that preached without the Biſhop's Licence, or againſt the Faith; and it was enacted,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170737:29"/>That all Tranſgreſſors of that ſort, ſhould be impriſoned, and within three Months be brought to a Trial: If upon Conviction they offered to abjure, and were not Relapſes, they were to be impriſoned and fined at pleaſure; and if they refuſed to abjure, or were Relapſes, they were to be delivered to the ſecular Arm, and the Magiſtrates were to burn them in ſome publick Place. But tho by this Statute no mention is made of ſending out a Writ for Execution; yet that continued ſtill, to be practiſed: And that ſame Year <hi>Sautre</hi> a Prieſt being condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a Relapſe, and degraded by <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a Writ was iſſued out for it, in which, <hi>Burning</hi> is called the <hi>Common Puniſhment,</hi> which related to the cuſtoms of other Nations: For this was the firſt Inſtance of that kind in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> In the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth's Reign, there was a Conſpiracy againſt the King diſcovered, (tho others that lived not long after, ſay it was only pretended and contrived by the Clergy) of <hi>Old-Caſtle</hi> and ſome others of <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Followers then called <hi>Lollards;</hi> upon which many were condemned both for Treaſon and Hereſy, who were firſt hanged and then burnt; and a Law followed that the <hi>Lollards</hi> ſhould forfeit all that they held in Fee-ſimple, as well as their Goods and Chattels to the King, and all Sheriffs and Magiſtrates were required to take an Oath, to deſtroy all Hereſies and <hi>Lollardies,</hi> and to aſſiſt the Ordinaries in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170737:29"/>their proceedings againſt them. Yet the Clergy making ill uſe of theſe Laws, and vexing all People that gave them any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, with long Impriſonments; the Judges interpoſed and examined the Grounds of their Commitments, and as they ſaw cauſe, Bailed, or Diſcharged the Priſoners; and took upon them to declare, what Opinions were Hereſies by Law, and what were not. Thus the People ſought for Shelter, under their Protection, and found more Mercy at the hands of Common Lawyers, than from them who ought to have been the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of their Souls, and the Publiſhers of the moſt merciful Religion that ever was.</p>
               <p>In the beginnings of this Reign,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of</hi> Lollards <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note> there were ſeveral Perſons brought into the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Courts for Hereſy, before <hi>Warham.</hi> Forty eight were accuſed: But of theſe, forty three abjured, twenty ſeven Men, and ſixteen Women, moſt of them being of <hi>Tenterden;</hi> and five of them, four Men, and one Woman, were condemned; ſome as obſtinate Hereticks, and others as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes: and againſt the common Ties of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Woman's Husband, and her two Sons, were brought Witneſſes againſt her. Upon their Conviction, a Certificate was made by the Archbiſhop to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery; upon which, ſince there is no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don upon Record, the Writs for burning them muſt have gone out in Courſe, and the Execution of them is little to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the Clergy were ſeldom guilty of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170737:30"/>much Mercy in ſuch Caſes, having deveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves of all Bowels, as the Dregs of unmortified Nature. The Articles ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to them were, That they believed that in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> there was nothing but material Bread; That the Sacraments of Baptiſm, Confirmation, Confeſſion, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and Extream Unction, were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary, nor profitable; That Prieſts had no more Power than Laymen; That Pilgrimages were not meritorious, and that the Mony and Labour ſpent in them, were ſpent in vain; That Images ought not to be worſhipped, and that they were only Stocks and Stones; That Prayers ought not to be made to Saints, but only to God; That there was no vertue in Holy-water, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-bread. Thoſe who abjured, did ſwear to diſcover all that held thoſe Errours, or were ſuſpected of them; and they were enjoyned to carry a Faggot in Proceſſion, and to wear on their Cloaths the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of one in Flames, as a publick Confeſſion that they had deſerved to be burnt. There were alſo four in <hi>London</hi> that abjured almoſt the ſame Opinions; and <hi>Fox</hi> ſays, that ſix were burnt in <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> who might be perhaps thoſe whom <hi>Warham</hi> had condemned; for there is no mention of any that were condemned in the Regiſters of <hi>London.</hi> By all this it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that many in this Nation, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive thoſe Doctrines, which were afterwards preached by the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, even before <hi>Luther</hi> began firſt to oppoſe Indulgences.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:170737:30"/>
               <p>The Riſe and Progreſs of his Doctrine are well known;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of</hi> Luthet's <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
                  </note> the Scandalous extolling of Indulgences gave the firſt occaſion to all that Contradiction, that followed between him and his followers, and the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> in which, if the Corruptions and Cruelties of the Clergy had not been ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and ſcandalous, ſo ſmall a matter could not have produced ſuch a Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but any Criſis will put ill humours in Fermentation.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops were groſly ignorant; they ſeldom reſided in their Dioceſſes, except it had been to riot it at high Feſtivals; and all the Effect their Reſidence could have, was to corrupt others, by their ill Example. They followed the Courts of Princes, and aſpired to the greateſt Offices. The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots and Monks were wholly given up to Luxury and Idleneſs; and the unmarried State, both of the Seculars, &amp; Regulars, gave infinite Scandal to the World; for it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the reſtraining them from having Wives of their own, made them conclude that they had a right to all other Mens. The Inferiour Clergy were no better; and not having places of retreat to conceal their vices in, as the Monks had, they became more publick. In ſum, all Ranks of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were ſo univerſally deſpiſed, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the World was very apt to be poſſeſſed with prejudice againſt their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, for the ſake of the Men, whoſe Intereſt it was to ſupport them: and the Worſhip of God was ſo defiled with much
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170737:31"/>groſs Superſtition, that without great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, all Men were eaſily convinced, that the Church ſtood in great need of a Reformation. This was much encreaſed when the Books of the Fathers began to be read, in which the difference between the former and latter Ages of the Church, did very evidently appear. They found that a blind Superſtition came firſt in the room of true Piety; and when by its means the Wealth and Intereſt of the Clergy was highly advanced; the Popes had upon that, eſtabliſhed their Tyranny; under which, not only the meaner People, but even the crowned Heads, had long groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. All theſe things concurred to make way for the Advancement of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And ſo the Books of the <hi>Germans</hi> being brought into <hi>England,</hi> and Tranſlated, many were prevailed on by them. Upon this, a hot Perſecution, which is alwayes the Foundation on which a vitious Clergy ſet up their Reſt, was vigorouſly ſet on foot, to ſuch a Degree, that ſix Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were burnt in <hi>Coventry</hi> in Paſſion-week, only for teaching their Children, the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Engliſh. Great Numbers were every where brought into the Biſhop's Courts; of whom ſome were burnt, but the greater part abjured.</p>
               <p>The King laid hold on this Occaſion, to become the Church's Champion, and wrote againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> as was formerly told. His Book beſides the Title of <hi>Defender of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170737:31"/>Faith,</hi> drew upon him all that Flattery could invent to extol it; yet <hi>Luther</hi> not daunted with ſuch an Antagoniſt, but rather proud of it, anſwered it, and treated him as much below the Reſpect that was due to a King, as his Flatterers had raiſed him above it. <hi>Tindal</hi>'s Tranſlation of the New Teſtament with ſome Notes added to it, drew a ſevere Condemnation from the Clergy, there being nothing in which they were more concerned, then to keep the People unacquainted with that Book. Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> ſeconded the King, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his Pen in the Service of the Clergy, but mixed too much Gall with his Ink. The Cardinal's Behaviour in this matter was unaccountable; for he not only acted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the new Preachers, but when ſome Biſhops moved for a Viſitation of the Univerſities, upon a report of the ſpreading of Hereſy in them, he ſtop'd it; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he called a Meeting of ſeveral Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Abbots and Divines, before whom, two Preachers, <hi>Bilney</hi> and <hi>Arthur,</hi> were brought, and Articles of Hereſy being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to them, and proved by Witneſſes, they for a while ſeemed reſolved to ſeal their Doctrines with their Blood; but what through Fear, what through Perſwaſion, they were prevailed on (firſt <hi>Arthur,</hi> and <hi>Bilney</hi> five days after) to abjure; but tho <hi>Bilney</hi> was a Relapſe, yet the Cardinal was gentle to him, and <hi>Tonſtall</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> injoyned him Penance, and diſcharged him. So much may ſuffice to ſhew the condition
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170737:32"/>of Affairs in <hi>England</hi> both in Church and State, when the Proceſs of the King's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce was firſt ſet on foot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh entered into a firm Alliance with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King's Marriage.</note> and agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Match between his Son Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> and <hi>Katherine</hi> the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> She came into <hi>England</hi> &amp; was married in <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1502"/> but on the ſecond of <hi>April</hi> after, the Prince died. They were not only bedded in Ceremony the night of the Marriage, but continued ſtill to lodg together, and the Prince by ſome indecent Rallery gave Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to believe, that the Marriage was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated, which was ſo little doubted, that ſome imputed his too early end to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in it. After his Death his younger Brother was not created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> till ten Months had paſt, it being then appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that the Princeſs was not with Child by the late Prince; Women were alſo ſet about her to wait on her with the Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is neceſſary in ſuch a Caſe; ſo that it was generally believed that ſhe was no Virgin when the Prince died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh being unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore ſo great a Portion as two hundred thouſand Ducats, propoſed a ſecond Match for her with his Younger Son <hi>Henry. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did then object againſt the Lawfulneſs of it; yet <hi>Fox</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> was for it, and the Opinion of the Pope's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was then ſo well eſtabliſhed, that it was thought a Diſpenſation from <hi>Rome</hi> was ſufficient to remove all Objections;
<note place="margin">Decemb. 1503.</note> ſo
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170737:32"/>one was obtained, grounded upon a deſire of the two young Perſons to marry toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for preſerving Peace between the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> by which the Pope diſpenſed with it notwithſtanding the Princeſs's Marriage to Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> which was (as is ſaid in the Bull) perhaps conſummated.</p>
               <p>The Pope was then in War with <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo would refuſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the King of <hi>England,</hi> being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not unwilling that Princes ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſuch Marriages, by which the Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their Iſſued epending on the Pope's Diſpenſation, they would be thereby obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Intereſt to ſupport that Authority:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1505"/> upon this a Marriage followed, the Prince being yet under Age; but the ſame day in which he came to be of Age, he did by his Father's Orders, make a Proteſtation that he retracted and annulled his Marriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh at his Death, charged him to break it off entirely, being perhaps apprehenſive of ſuch a return of Confuſion upon a controverted Succeſſion to the Crown, as had been during the Wars of the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> but upon his Death, <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth being then eighteen Years of Age, married her: She bore him two Sons, who died ſoon after they were born; and a Daughter <hi>Mary,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1516"/> that lived to reign after him;
<note place="margin">Matches propoſed for his Daughter.</note> but after that the Queen contracted ſome Diſeaſes that made her unacceptable to the King; ſo all hope of any other Iſſue failing, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170737:33"/>Matches were propoſed for his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the firſt was with the <hi>Dauphin;</hi> then ſhe was contracted with the Emperor; and after that, a Propoſition was made for the King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and laſt of all a Treaty was made with <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, either for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he being then a Widower, or for his ſecond Son the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd at his Option; upon which the Biſhop of <hi>Tarbe</hi> was ſent over Ambaſſador to conclude it; he made an Exception that the Marriage was doubtful and the Lady not legitimate, which had been likewiſe made by the Cortes of <hi>Spain,</hi> by whoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice the Emperor broke the Contract upon that very account, ſo that other Princes moving Scruples againſt a Marriage with his Daughter, the Heir of ſo great a Crown, the King began to make ſome himſelf, or rather to publiſh them, for he ſaid after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he had them ſome Years before.</p>
               <p>Yet the Cardinal's hatred to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, was look'd on as one of the ſecret Springs of the King's Averſion to his Aunt, which the King vindicating him in publick, afterwards did not remove: that being conſidered only as a Court Contrivance.</p>
               <p>The King ſeemed to lay the greateſt Weight on the prohibition in the Levitical Law of marrying the Brother's Wife,
<note place="margin">The King has ſome ſcruples concerning his Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> and he being converſant in <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi>'s Writings, found that he and the other Schoolmen look'd on thoſe Laws as Moral, and for ever binding, and that by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the Pope's Diſpenſation was of no
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170737:33"/>force ſince his Authority went not ſo far as to diſpence with the Laws of God. All the Biſhops of <hi>England, Fiſher</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> only excepted, declared under their Hands and Seals, that they judged the Marriage unlawful. The ill Conſequences of Wars that might follow upon a doubtful Title to the Crown, were alſo much conſidered, or at leaſt pretended. It is not probable that the engagement of the King's Affections to any other gave the riſe to all this; for ſo pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Courtier as <hi>Wolſey</hi> was, would have diſcovered it, and not have projected a Marriage with <hi>Francis</hi>'s Siſter, if he had ſeen the King prepoſſeſſed: It is more probable that the King conceiving himſelf upon the point of being diſcharged of his former Marriage, gave a free ſcope to his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which upon that came to ſettle on <hi>Anne Bolleyn.</hi> The King had reaſon enough to expect a quick and favourable diſpatch of his buſineſs at <hi>Rome,</hi> where Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Divorces in Favour of Princes uſed to paſs, rather with regard to the Merits of the Prince that deſired them, than of the Cauſe it ſelf. His Alliance ſeemed then neceſſary to the Pope, who was at that time in Captivity. Nor could the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with any good colour oppoſe his Suit, ſince he had broken his Contract with his Daughter upon the account of the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Marriage.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal had alſo given him full Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of a good Anſwer from <hi>Rome;</hi> whether upon the knowledg he had of that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170737:34"/>Court, and of the Pope's temper, or upon any promiſe made him, is not certain. The Reaſons gathered by the Canoniſts for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling the Bull of Diſpenſation, upon which the Divorce was to follow in courſe, were grounded upon ſome falſe ſuggeſtions in the Bull, and upon the Proteſtation which the King had made when he came to be of Age. In a word, they were ſuch, that a favourable Pope left to himſelf, would have yielded to them without any ſcruple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anne Bolleyn</hi> was born in the year 1507, and went to <hi>France</hi> at ſeven years of Age, and returned twelve years after to <hi>England.</hi> She was much admired in both Courts, and continued to live without any Blemiſh till her unfortunate Fall gave occaſion to ſome malicious Writers to defame her in all the Parts of her Life; She was more beautiful than graceful, and more chearful than di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet. She wanted none of the Charms of Wit or Perſon, and muſt have had extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Attractives; ſince ſhe could ſo long manage ſuch a King's Affection, in which her being with Child ſoon after the Marriage, ſhews that in the whole courſe of ſeven years ſhe kept him at a due diſtance. Upon her coming to <hi>England,</hi> the Lord <hi>Piercy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then a Domeſtick of the Cardinals, made love to her, and went ſo far as to engage himſelf ſome way to marry her, and that being entertained by her, ſhews ſhe had then no aſpirings to the Crown. But the Cardinal having underſtood ſomewhat of the King's ſecret Intentions, did ſo threaten
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170737:34"/>him, that he made him, tho not without great difficulty, break off his addreſſes to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knight,</hi> then Secretary of State,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1527"/> was ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to prepare the Pope in the matter;
<note place="margin">And ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to the Pope.</note> and the Family of the <hi>Caſſali</hi> having much of the Pope's Favour, they were likewiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to promote it. To <hi>Gregory Caſſali</hi> did the Cardinal ſend a large Diſpatch, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth all the Reaſons both in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Policy, for obtaining a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himſelf to judge the Affair. Great Promiſes were made in the King's Name, both for publick and private Services, and nothing was forgot that was likely to work either on the Pope, or thoſe Cardinals that had the greateſt Credit about him. <hi>Knight</hi> made application to the Pope in the ſecreteſt manner he could, and had a very favourable Anſwer; for the Pope promiſed frankly to diſſolve the Marriage: but another Promiſe being exacted of him in the Emperour's Name, not to proceed in that Affair, he was reduced to great ſtraits, not ſo much out of regard to his Promiſes, (for he had ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf, that it was unavoidable for him to break one) as to his Intereſts; he was then at the Emperour's mercy, ſo he was in fear of offending him, yet he both hated him, and was diſtruſtful of him; and had no mind to loſe the King of <hi>England,</hi> therefore he ſtudied to gain time, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that if the King would have a little patience, he ſhould not only have that which he asked, but every thing that was in his power to grant.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:170737:35"/>
               <p>The Cardinal <hi>Sanctorum quatuor</hi> made ſome Scruples concerning the Bull that was demanded,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1528"/> till he had raiſed his price, and got a great Preſent, and then the Pope ſigned both a Commiſſion for <hi>Wolſey</hi> to try the Cauſe,
<note place="margin">Who was very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable.</note> and judge in it, and alſo a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and put them in <hi>Knights</hi> hands; but with tears prayed him that there might be no proceedings upon them, till the Emperour were put out of a capacity of executing his Revenge upon him, and when ever that was done he would own this act of Juſtice which he did in the King's favour. For tho the Pope on publick occaſions uſed to talk in the language of one that pretended to be S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Succeſſor; yet in private Treaties he minded nothing but his own Security, and the Intereſts of his Family. And being a very crafty Man, he propoſed an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, which if the King had followed, it had put a quicker and eaſier end to the Proceſs. He found his ſending Bulls, or a Legat to <hi>England,</hi> would become publick, and draw the Emperour upon him, and muſt admit of delays and be full of danger; therefore he propoſed, if the King was ſatisfied in his own Conſcience, in which he believed no Doctor could reſolve him better than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then he might without more noiſe make Judgment be given in <hi>England;</hi> and upon that marry another Wife, and ſend over to <hi>Rome</hi> for a Confirmation; which would be the more eaſily granted, if the thing were once done. This the Pope deſired might be repreſented to the King as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170737:35"/>of the Cardinals, and not as his own. But the King's Counſellers thought this more dangerous than the way of a Proceſs; for if upon the King's ſecond Marriage, a Confirmation ſhould be denyed, then the Right Succeſſion by it, would be ſtill very doubtful, ſo they would not venture on it.</p>
               <p>The Pope was at this time diſtaſted with Cardinal <hi>Wolſey;</hi> for he underſtood, that during his Captivity, he had been in an Intrigue, to get himſelf choſen Vicar of the Papacy, and was to have ſate at <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> which might have produced a new Schiſm. <hi>Staphileus,</hi> Dean of the <hi>Rota,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in <hi>England,</hi> was wrought on by the promiſe of a Biſhoprick, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation to a Cardinals Hat, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the King's Affair; and by him the Cardinal wrote to the Pope, in a moſt earneſt ſtrain, for a diſpatch of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and he deſired, that an indifferent and <hi>tractable</hi> Cardinal might be ſent over, with a full Commiſſion to joyn with him, and to judge the matter; propoſing to the King's Embaſſadours, <hi>Campegio</hi> as the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Man; when a Legate ſhould be named, he ordered Preſents to be made him, and that they would haſten his diſpatch, and take care that the Commiſſion ſhould be full. But upon the Arrival of the Couriers, that were ſent from <hi>Rome, Gardiner,</hi> the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Secretary, and <hi>Fox,</hi> the Kings Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner, the one a Canoniſt, and the other a Divine, were ſent thither with Letters, both from the King and Cardinal, to the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170737:36"/>Pope, &amp; they carried orders (that were like to be more effectual than any Arguments they could offer) to make great Preſents to the Cardinals. They carried with them the draught of a Bull, containing all the Clauſes could be invented, to make the matter ſure; one Clauſe was to declare the Iſſue of the Marriage good, as being begotten <hi>bona fide,</hi> which was perhaps put in to make the Queen more eaſy, ſince by that it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that her Daughter ſhould not ſuffer, which way ſoever the matter went.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal in his Letters to <hi>Caſſali,</hi> offered to take the blame on his own Soul, if the Pope would grant this Bull; and with an Earneſtneſs, as hearty and warm, as can be expreſſed in Words, he preſſed the thing, and added, That he perceived, that if the Pope continued Inexorable, the King would proceed another way.</p>
               <p>Theſe Intreaties had ſuch Effects,
<note place="margin">Campegio <hi>ſent over Legate.</hi>
                  </note> That <hi>Campegio</hi> was declared Legate, and ordered to go for <hi>England,</hi> and joyn in Commiſſion with <hi>Wolſey,</hi> for judging this matter. <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pegio</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Saliebury;</hi> and having a Son whom he intended to advance, was no doubt a tractable Man; but to raiſe his price the higher, he moved many Scruples, and ſeemed to enter upon this Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with great fear, and averſion. <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> who knew his Temper, preſt him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently, to make all the haſt he could, and gave him the Aſſurance of great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from the King: For whatever was to be made uſe of publickly for formes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170737:36"/>ſake, theſe were the effectual Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were moſt likely to convince a Man of his Temper: In which <hi>Wolſey</hi> was ſo ſincere, that in a Letter he wrote to him, that of a good Conſcience, being put among other Motives to perſwade him, in the firſt Draught, the Cardinal ſtruck it out, as knowing how little it would ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify. <hi>Campegio</hi> ſet out from <hi>Rome,</hi> and carried with him a Decretal Bull, for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling the Marriage which was truſted to him, and he was Authorized to ſhew it to the King and <hi>Wolſey;</hi> but was required not to give it out of his Hands to either of them. At this time, <hi>Wolſey</hi> was taken with the ſweating Sickneſs, which then raged in <hi>England;</hi> and by a Complement which both the King and <hi>Ann Boleyn</hi> writ him, on the ſame piece of Paper, it appears, he was then privy to the Kings Deſign of marrying her, and intended to advance himſelf yet higher, by his merits, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing her the Crown.</p>
               <p>This Year he ſettled his two great Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; and finding both the King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple much pleaſed with his converting ſome Monaſteries to ſuch uſes, he intended to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs more, and to convert them to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks, and Cathedral Churches, which the Pope was not willing to grant, the Religious Orders making great Oppoſition to it; but <hi>Gardiner</hi> told him, <hi>it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and muſt be done;</hi> ſo a power for doing it, was added to the Legates Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:170737:37"/>
               <p>At this time, the Queen engaged the Emperor to eſpouſe her Intereſts, which he did, the more willingly, becauſe the King was then in the Intereſts of <hi>France;</hi> and to help her Buſineſs, a Breve was either found, or forged, (the laſt is more probable) of the ſame date with the Bull, that diſpenſed with her Marriage: But with ſtronger Clauſes in it,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1528"/> to anſwer thoſe Objections that were made againſt ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the Bull, though it did not ſeem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that in the ſame Day, a Bull and a Breve would have been granted for the ſame thing, in ſuch different ſtrains. The moſt conſiderable Variation was, That whereas the Bull did only ſuppoſe, that the Queens Marriage with Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> was <hi>perhaps</hi> Conſummated; the Breve did ſuppoſe it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly, without a <hi>perhaps.</hi> This was thought to prejudice the Queen's Cauſe as much, as the Suſpicion of the Forgery did blemiſh her Agents.</p>
               <p>In <hi>October,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Campegio <hi>comes into</hi> England.</note> 
                  <hi>Campegio</hi> came into <hi>England;</hi> and after the firſt Complements were over, he firſt adviſed the King to give over the Proſecution of his Suit; and then coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled the Queen in the Pope's Name, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Religious Life, and make Vows; but both were in vain; and he by affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Impartiality, almoſt loſt both ſides. But he in great meaſure pacified the King, when he ſhewed him the Bull he had brought over for annulling the Marriage; yet he would not part with it out of his hands, neither to the King, nor the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170737:37"/>upon which, great Inſtances were made at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Campegio</hi> might be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to ſhew it to ſome of the King's Counſellors, and to go on and end the buſineſs, otherwiſe <hi>Wolſey</hi> would be ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>England</hi> loſt: Yet all this did not prevail on the crafty Pope, who knew it was intended once to have the Bull out of <hi>Campegio</hi>'s hands, and then the King would leave him to the Emperour's Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But tho he poſitively refuſed to grant that, yet he ſaid, he left the Legates in <hi>England,</hi> free to judge as they ſaw Cauſe, and promiſed that he would confirm their Sentence.</p>
               <p>The Imperialiſts at <hi>Rome</hi> preſſed him hard, to inhibit the Legates, and to recall the Cauſe that it might be heard before the Conſiſtory. The Pope declined this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to mollify the King, he ſent <hi>Campana,</hi> one of his Bed-chamber,
<note place="margin">Campana <hi>ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the King.</hi>
                  </note> over to <hi>England,</hi> with Complements too high to gain much Credit: He aſſured the King, that the Pope would do for him all he could, not only in <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi> but in the <hi>fulneſs of his Power:</hi> And that tho he had reaſon to be very apprehenſive, of the Emperour's Reſentments, yet that did not divert him from his Zeal for the King's Service; for if his reſigning the Popedome would advance it, it ſhould not ſtick at that. He alſo was ordered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Legates, to put a ſpeedy end to the buſineſs; but his ſecret Inſtructions to <hi>Campegio</hi> were of another ſtrain; he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170737:38"/>charged him to burn the Bull, and to draw out the matter by all the delayes he could invent. Sir <hi>Francis Brian,</hi> and <hi>Peter Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> were diſpatched to <hi>Rome,</hi> with new Propoſitions, to try, whether, if both the King and Queen took Religious Vowes, ſo that their Marriage were upon that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled, the Pope would engage to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with the King's Vow, or grant him a Licenſe for having two Wives. <hi>Wolſey</hi> alſo offered in the King's Name, to ſettle a Pay for 2000 Men, that ſhould be a Guard to the Pope, and to procure a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of ſome of his Towns, on which the <hi>Venetians</hi> had ſeized. But the Pope did not care to have his Guards payed by other Princes; which he looked on as a putting himſelf in their hands. He was in fear of every thing that might bring a new Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity upon him; and was now reſolved to unite himſelf firmly with the Emperour, by whoſe means only, he hoped to reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his Family at <hi>Florence;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Pope reſolved to unite with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> and ever after this, all the uſe he made of the King's Earneſtneſs in his Divorce, was only, to draw in the Emperour to his Intereſts, on the better Terms. The Emperour was alſo then preſſing him hard, for a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council; of which, beſides the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had to it, he had particular reaſon to be afraid; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Baſtard, he was threatned with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition as uncapable, by the Canons of the Church, to hold ſuch a Dignity. The Pope propoſed a Journey <hi>incognito,</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:170737:38"/>and deſired <hi>Wolſey</hi> to go with him, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a General Peace. But in ſecret, he was making up with the Emperour, and gave his Agents Aſſurances, that tho the Legates gave Sentence, he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it. So the King's Correſpondents at <hi>Rome,</hi> wrote to him, to ſet on the War more vigorouſly againſt the Emperour, for he could expect nothing at <hi>Rome,</hi> unleſs the Emperour's Affairs declined.</p>
               <p>The Pope went on cajoling thoſe the King ſent over, and gave new Aſſurances,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1529"/> that tho he would not grant a Bull, by which the Divorce ſhould be immediately his own Act; yet he would confirm the Legates Sentence ſo he reſolved: to caſt the Load wholly upon them: if he ſaid he did it himſelf, a Council would be called by the Emperour's means, in which, his Bull would be annulled, and himſelf depoſed, which would bring on a new Confuſion; and that, conſidering the footing Hereſy had got, would ruine the Church. The Pope inclined more to the diſſolving the Marriage, by the Queen's taking Vowes, as that which could be beſt defended; but the Cardinal gave him notice, that the Queen would never be brought to that, unleſs her Nephews adviſed it.</p>
               <p>At this time,
<note place="margin">The Pope's Sickneſs.</note> the Pope was taken ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ill, and fell in a great Sickneſs; upon which, the Imperialiſts began to prepare for a Conclave: But <hi>Farneſe,</hi> and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Mantua</hi> oppoſed them, and ſeemed to have Inclination for <hi>Wolſey.</hi> Whom, as

                  </note> then on his way to <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1528"/> whith large Directions, how to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the Election; It was reckoned, that the King of <hi>France,</hi> joyning heartily with the King, of which he ſeemed confident; there were only ſix Cardinals wanting, to make the Election ſure, and beſides Summes of Mony, and other Rewards, that were to be diſtributed among them; he was to give them aſſurance, that the Cardinals Preferments ſhould be divided among them. Theſe were the ſecret Methods of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chair: And indeed it would puſle a Man of an ordinary degree of Creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to think, That one choſen by ſuch means, could be Chriſt's Vicar, and the infallible Judge of Controverſies. But the Pope's Recovery, put an end to thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, which yet were ſoon after revived, by a long and dangerous Relapſe. Then great pains was taken, to gain many Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals to favour the King's Cauſe; and many Precedents were found of Divorces, granted in Favour of Princes, upon much ſlighter grounds. But the Imperialiſts were ſo ſtrong at <hi>Rome,</hi> that they could not hope to prevail, if the Emperour was not firſt gained; ſo there was a ſecret Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation ſet on foot with him, but it had no other Effect, ſave that it gave great Jealouſy, both to the Pope, and the King of <hi>France.</hi> Another diſpatch was ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> to procure a Commiſſion, with fuller
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170737:39"/>powers in it to the Legates, and a Promiſe under the Pope's hand to confirm their Sentence; the latter was granted,
<note place="margin">The Pope promiſed to confirm any Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence the Legates ſhould give.</note> but the former was refuſed, for the Pope was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go no further in that Matter, tho <hi>Wolſey</hi> wrote to <hi>Rome,</hi> that if any Juſtice were denied the King, not only <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>France</hi> likewiſe would withdraw their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from the Apoſtolick See; becauſe by that it would be inferred, that the Emperour had ſuch Influence at <hi>Rome,</hi> as to oblige the Pope to be partial or favourable as he pleaſed. At this time the Cardinal was cheapning his Bulls for <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> which were rated at 15000 Ducats, but ſince it was a Tranſlation from <hi>Dureſm,</hi> ſo that a new Compoſition would come in for that Vacancy, he refuſed to pay above a third of what was demanded.</p>
               <p>The Emperour's Ambaſſadour made a Proteſtation at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Queen's Name againſt the Legates as partial in the King's Favour, which the Pope received. <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> that was a Man of great Craft, and could penetrate well into Secrets, wrote to the King, aſſuring him, that he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing more from the Pope,

He was ſo fearful, and under ſuch irreſolution
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170737:40"/>that he could be brought to do nothing with Vigor: This <hi>Gardiner</hi> deſired might not be ſhewn to the Cardinal; for he was now ſetting up for himſelf, and had a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Correſpondence with <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi> who in one of her Letters to him as a token of ſpecial Favour, ſent him ſome Cramp Rings that the King had Bleſſed, of which the Office is extant; and <hi>Gardiner</hi> in one of his Letters ſays, They were much eſteemed for the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that was believed to be in them. In the Promiſe which the Pope ſigned to confirm the Sentence that ſhould be given by the Legates, ſome Clauſes were put, by which he could eaſily break looſe from it; ſo he endeavoured to get another in fuller termes, by this Artifice: He told the Pope, that the Courier had met with an Accident in paſſing a River, by which the Promiſe was ſo ſpoiled with Water, that it could not be made uſe of. But the Pope inſtead of being catched with this, to give a new one, ſeemed glad that it was ſpoiled, and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively refuſed to renew it. And a long and earneſt Letter which the Legates wrote to the Pope, preſſing him to end the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter roundly by a Decretal Bull, aſſuring him it was only ſcruple of Conſcience that wrought on the King, and no deſire of a new Wife, and that the whole Nation was much offended with the delays of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which they were all ſo much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, wrought nothing on him; for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that as done by them only in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the King, who thought he had
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170737:40"/>intirely gained <hi>Campegio,</hi> and the ſcandals of his Life were ſo publick, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Intereſt were likely to prevail on him more than any other: but by all the Arts that were uſed, they were not able to over-reach the Pope, who whatever he might be in his Deciſions, ſeemed infallible in his Sagacity and Jealouſy. The Queen's Agents preſſed hard for an Avocation, but the Pope was unwilling to grant that, till he had finiſhed his Treaty in all other points with the Emperour, and he began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain much of the cold Proceedings of the Confederates, and that they expoſed him ſo much not only to the Emperour's Mercy, but to the ſcorn of the <hi>Florentines:</hi> by this it was viſible, he was ſeeking a Colour for caſting himſelf into the Emperour's Arms: great Objections were made to the Motion for an Avocation, it was contrary to the King's Prerogative to be cited to <hi>Rome,</hi> and it was ſaid he would ſeek Juſtice of the Clergy of <hi>Engl.</hi> if the Pope denied it. It was alſo contrary to the Promiſe under the Popes hand, and his Faith often given by word of mouth, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of late by <hi>Campana,</hi> to recal the Legat's Commiſſion: but verbal Promiſes did not bind the Pope much, they vaniſhed into Air; and <hi>Campana</hi> ſwore that he had not made any, and for the written Promiſe, there was a Clauſe put in it, by which he could eſcape, ſo that he was at liberty from all Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments but thoſe he had privately given in diſcourſe, and to theſe he was no Slave.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:170737:41"/>
               <p>The Legates began the Proceſs in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> after the neceſſary Preliminaries: the Queen appeared, and proteſted againſt them as imcompetent Judges:
<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs begun in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> endeavours were uſed to terrify her into ſome compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; it was given out that ſome had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to kill the King or the Cardinal, and that ſhe had ſome hand in it, that ſhe carried very diſobligingly to the King, and uſed many indecent Arts to be popular; that the King was in danger of his Life by her means, and ſo could no more keep her company neither in Bed nor at Board; but ſhe was a Woman of ſo reſolute a mind, that no Threatnings could daunt her. When both the King and She were together in the Court, the Queen inſtead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the Legates, kneeled down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, and ſpake in a manner that raiſed Compaſſion in all that were preſent; ſhe ſaid, She had been his Wife theſe twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years, had born him ſeveral Children, and had always ſtudied to pleaſe him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe deſired to know wherein ſhe had at any time offended him. As for their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage it was made by both their Parents, who were eſteemed wiſe Princes, and had no doubt good Counſellours when their Match was agreed on; but at preſent ſhe neither had indifferent Judges, nor could ſhe expect that her Lawyers being his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects durſt ſpeak freely for her, and therefore ſhe could not expect Juſtice there; ſo ſhe went out of the Court, and would never return to it any more. Upon this the King
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170737:41"/>gave her a great Character for her extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Qualities, and proteſted, he was acted by no other Principle, then that of Conſcience. He added, that <hi>Wolſey</hi> did not ſet him on to this Suit, but had oppoſed it long: that he firſt moved the matter in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him the Reſolution of the Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> in his Caſe; and that they had all under their hands declared, that his Marriage was unlawful. The Biſhop of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> denied he had ſigned it; but <hi>Warham</hi> pretended, he gave him leave to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother write his Name to it. <hi>Fiſher</hi> denied this, and it was no way probable.</p>
               <p>The Legates went on according to the forms of Law,
<note place="margin">The Queen appeals to the Pope.</note> tho the Queen appealed from them to the Pope, and excepted both to the Place, to the Judges, and her Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers: Yet they pronounced her <hi>Contumax,</hi> and went on to Examine Witneſſes; chiefly, to that particular of the Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of her Marriage with Prince <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur.</hi> But now ſince the Proceſs was thus going on, the Emperours Agents preſt the Pope vehemently for an Avocation; and all poſſible endeavours were uſed by the King's Agents to hinder it; they ſpared nothing that would work on the Pope, either in the way of perſwaſion, or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: It was told him, that there was a Treaty ſet on foot, between the King, and the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi> and that upon the Pope's declaring himſelf ſo
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170737:42"/>partial, as to grant the Avocation, he would certainly imbark in the ſame Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts with them. But the Pope thought the King was ſo far ingaged in Honour in the Points of Religion, that he would not be prevailed with to unite with <hi>Luther</hi>'s Followers: So he did not imagine, that the Effects of his granting the Avocation, would be ſo diſmal, as the Cardinal's crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures repreſented them: He thought it would probably ruine him, which might make his Agents uſe ſuch Threatnings, and he did not much conſider that, for he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in his heart. So in Concluſion, after the Emperour had engaged to him, to reſtore his Family to the Government of <hi>Florence,</hi> he reſolved to publiſh his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with him: But that the granting the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, might not look like (what indeed it was) a ſecret Article, he reſolved to begin with that; and with great ſigns of ſorrow, he told the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſadours, that he was forced to it; both becauſe all the Lawyers told him, it could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and that he could not reſiſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Forces, which ſurrounded him on all hands. Their endeavours to gain a little time by delayes, were as fruitleſs as their other Arts had been, for on the 15th of <hi>July,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Pope grants an Avocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> the Pope ſigned it, and on the 19th, he ſent it by an expreſs Meſſenger to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Legates, <hi>Campegio</hi> in particular, drew out the matter, by all the delayes they could contrive, and gained much
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170737:42"/>time. At laſt, it being brought to that, that Sentence was to be pronounced, <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pegio,</hi> inſtead of doing it, adjourned the Court till <hi>October,</hi> and ſaid, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the Conſiſtory, muſt obſerve their times of Vacation. This gave the King and all his Court great offence, when they ſaw what was like to be the Iſſue of a Proceſs; on which the King was ſo much bent; and in which he was ſo far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, both in Honour and Intereſt. <hi>Campegio</hi> had nothing to loſe in <hi>England,</hi> but the Biſhoprick of <hi>Sailisbury,</hi> for which, the Pope or Emperour could eaſily recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence him; but <hi>Wolſey</hi> was under all the Terrours, that an Inſolent Favorite is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to, upon a change in his Fortune; None being more abject in misfortune, than thoſe that are lifted up with Succeſs. When the Avocation was brought to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the King was willing, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates ſhould declare their Commiſſion void, but would not ſuffer the Letters Citatory to be ſerved, for he looked upon it as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Dignity to be cited to appear at <hi>Rome.</hi> The King governed himſelf upon this occaſion, with more temper than was expected: He diſmiſſed <hi>Campegio</hi> civily, only his Officers ſearched his Coffers, when he went beyond Sea, with deſign, as was thought, to ſee if the Decretal Bull could be found. <hi>Wolſey</hi> was now upon the point of being diſgraced, tho the King ſeemed to treat him with the ſame Confidence he had formerly put in him; it being ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170737:43"/>for many Princes to hide their deſigns of diſgracing their Favourites, with high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Expreſſions of kindneſſes than ordinary, till their Ruine breaks out the more violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe it is not foreſeen.</p>
               <p>At this time,
<note place="margin">Cranmer's <hi>Riſe.</hi>
                  </note> Dr. <hi>Cranmer,</hi> a Fellow of <hi>Jeſus-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> meeting acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally with <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and <hi>Fox,</hi> at <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> and being put on the Diſcourſe of the King's Marriage, propoſed a new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which was, That the King ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the chief Univerſities, and Divines of <hi>Europe,</hi> to examine the lawfulneſs of his Marriage; and if they gave their Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt it, then it being certain, that the Pope's Diſpenſation could not derogate from the Law of God, the Marriage muſt be declared null: This was new, and ſeemed reaſonable; ſo they propoſed it to the King, who was much taken with it, and ſaid, <hi>he had the Sow by the right Ear:</hi> He ſaw this way was both better in it ſelf, and would mortify the Pope extreamly; ſo <hi>Cranmer</hi> was ſent for, and did ſo behave himſelf, that the King conceived an high opinion, both of his Learning and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and of his Probity and Sincerity, which took ſuch root in the King's mind, that no Artifices, nor Calumnies, were ever able to remove it.</p>
               <p>But as he was thus in his Riſe,
<note place="margin">Wolſey <hi>it diſgraced.</hi>
                  </note> ſo <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> did now decline. The Great Seal was taken from him, and given to Sir <hi>Thomas Moor:</hi> And he was ſued in a Premunire, for having held the Legatine Courts by a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170737:43"/>Forraign Authority, contrary the Laws of <hi>England:</hi> He confeſſed the Indictment, and pleaded Ignorance, and ſubmitted himſelf to the King's Mercy; ſo Judgment paſſed on him: Then was his rich Palace (now <hi>Whitehall</hi>) and Royal Furniture, ſeized on to the King's uſe: Yet the King received him again into his Protection, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him the Temporalities of the Sees of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and above 6000 <hi>l.</hi> in Plate, and other Goods: And there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſtill great and clear Prints in the King's mind, of that entire Confidence, to which he had received him: of which, as his Enemies were very apprehenſive, ſo he himſelf was ſo much tranſported with the Meſſages he had concerning it, that once he fell down on his knees in a Kennel before them that brought them. Articles were put in againſt him, in the Houſe of Lords; it ſeems, for a Bill of Attainder, where he had but few Friends; which all inſolent Favourites may expect in their Diſgrace. In the Houſe of Commons, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> that had been his Secretary, did ſo manage the matter, that it came to nothing. This failing, his Enemies procured an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be ſent to him, to go into <hi>Yorkshire:</hi> Thither he went in great State, with 160 Horſes in his Train, and 72 Carts follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and there he lived ſome time: But the King was informed, that he was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing with the Pope, and the Emperour: So the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was ſent to arreſt him of high Treaſon, and bring him
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170737:44"/>up to <hi>London.</hi> On the way he ſickned,

<note place="margin">His Death.</note> tho the laſt be the truer. In Concluſion, he died at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> making great Proteſtations, of his conſtant Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the King, particularly in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Divorce: And he wiſhed he had ſerved God, as faithfully as he had done the King; for then he would not have caſt him off in his gray Hairs, as the King had done. Words that declining Favourites are apt to reflect on, but they ſeldom remember them in the hight of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>The King thought it neceſſary, to ſecure himſelf of the Affections, and Confidences of his People, before he would venture on any thing that ſhould diſpleaſe two ſuch mighty Potentates, as the Pope, and the Emperour.
<note place="margin">A Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called.</note> So a Parliament was called; in it the Commons prepared ſeveral Bills, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome of the Corruptions of the Clergy; particularly, againſt Plurality of Benefices, and Non-reſidence: Abuſes, that even Popery it ſelf, could not but condemn. The Clergy abhorred the Precedent of the Commons, medling in Eccleſiaſtical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; ſo <hi>Fiſher</hi> ſpoke vehemently againſt them, and ſaid, all this flowed from <hi>lack of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this, the Commons complained of him to the King, for reproaching them; the Houſe of Peers either thought it no breach of Priviledge, or were willing to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170737:44"/>wink at it, for they did not interpoſe. <hi>Fiſher</hi> was hated by the Court, for adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo firmly to the Queen's Intereſts;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1530"/> ſo he was made to explain himſelf, and it was paſſed over.</p>
               <p>The Bills were much oppoſed by the Clergy, but in the end they were paſſed,
<note place="margin">The Kings Debts are diſcharged</note> and had the Royal Aſſent. In this long Interval of Parliament, the King had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed great Sums of Mony; ſo the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both to diſcourage that way of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Kings for the Future; and for ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining the Cardinal's Creatures, who had been moſt forward to lend, as having the greateſt Advantages from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did by an Act diſcharge the King of all thoſe Debts. The King granted a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pardon, with an exception of ſuch as had incurred the pains of Premunire, by acknowledging a Forraign Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with deſign to terrify the Pope, and keep the Clergy under the laſh. The King found it neceſſary, to make all ſure at home, for now were the Pope and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, linkt in the firmeſt Friendſhip poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; The Pope's Nephew was made Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and married the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's Natural Daughter. A Peace was alſo made between <hi>Francis</hi> and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; and the King found it not ſo eaſy, to make him break with the Pope, upon his account, as he had expected. The Emperour went into <hi>Italy,</hi> and was crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Pope; who when the Emperour was kneeling down to kiſs his Foot, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170737:45"/>himſelf ſo far as to draw it in, and kiſs his Cheek.</p>
               <p>But now the King intending to proceed in the Method propoſed by <hi>Cranmer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King's Marriage.</note> ſent to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Cambridg,</hi> to procure their Concluſions. At <hi>Oxford,</hi> it was referred by the major part of the Convocation, to thirty three Doctors and Batchelors of Divinity, whom that Faculty was to name; they were impowered to determine the Queſtion, and put the Seal of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity to their Concluſion: And they gave their Opinions, that the Marriage of the Brother's Wife, was contrary both to the Laws of God, and Nature. At <hi>Cambridg,</hi> the Convocation was unwilling to refer it to a ſelect number; yet it was after ſome days Practice, obtained, but with great difficulty, that it ſhould be referred to twenty nine; of which number, two thirds agreeing, they were empowered to put the Seal of the Univerſity to their Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: Theſe agreed in Opinion, with thoſe of <hi>Oxford.</hi> The jealouſy that went of Dr. <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s favouring Lutheraniſm, made, that the fierce Popiſh Party, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed every thing in which he was ſo far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. They were alſo afraid of <hi>Ann Bolleyn</hi>'s Advancement, who was believed tinctured with thoſe Opinions. <hi>Crook,</hi> a learned Man in the Greek Tongue, was imployed in <hi>Italy,</hi> to procure the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divines there; in which, he was ſo ſucceſsful, that beſides the great diſcoveries he made in ſearching the Manuſcripts of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170737:45"/>the Greek Fathers, concerning their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in this point, he engaged ſeveral Perſons to write for the King's Cauſe; and alſo got the <hi>Jews</hi> to give their Opinions of the Laws in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> that they were Moral and Obligatory: Yet when a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died without Iſſue, his Brother might marry his Widow within <hi>Judea,</hi> for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their Families, and Succeſſion; but they thought that might not be done out of <hi>Judea.</hi> The State of <hi>Venice</hi> would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves, but ſaid they would be Neutrals; and it was not eaſy to perſwade the Divines of the Republick, to give their Opinions, till a Brief was obtained of the Pope, permitting all Divines, and Canoniſts, to deliver their Opinions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Conſciences; which was not granted but with great difficulty. <hi>Crook</hi> was not in a condition to corrupt any, for he complained in all his Letters, of the great want he was in: And he was in ſuch ill terms with <hi>John Caſſali,</hi> the King's Embaſſadour at <hi>Venice,</hi> that he complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much of him to the King, and was in fear of being poyſoned by him. The Pope abhorred this way of proceeding, though he could not decently oppoſe it; but he ſaid in great ſcorn, that no Friar ſhould ſet Limits to his Power. <hi>Crook</hi> was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give no Mony, nor make Promiſes to any, till they had freely delivered their Opinion; which as he writ, he had ſo carefully obſerved, that he offered to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit his Head, if the contrary were found
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170737:46"/>true. Fifteen, or Twenty Crowns, was all the reward he gave, even to thoſe that wrot for the King's Cauſe; and a few Crowns he gave to ſome of thoſe that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: But the Emperour rewarded thoſe that wrot againſt the Divorce, with good Beneſices; ſo little reaſon there was to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Subſcriptions he procured to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; the contrary of which, appears by his Original Accounts, yet extant. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, many Divines, and Canoniſts; not only whole Houſes of Religious Orders, but even the Univerſity of <hi>Bononia,</hi> tho the Pope's Town, declared, that the Laws in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> about the degrees of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, were parts of the Law of Nature; and that the Pope could not diſpenſe with them.

               <p>
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> thought the Marriage was null, and they all agreed, that the Pope's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation was of no force. <hi>Oſiander</hi> was imploied to engage the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divines, but they were affraid of giving the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour new grounds of diſpleaſure. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanctthon</hi> thought the Law in <hi>Leviticus</hi> was diſpenſable, and that the Marriage might be lawful; and that in thoſe matters, States and Princes might make what Laws they pleaſed; And though the Divines of <hi>Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> after much diſputing about it, did agree, that theſe Laws were moral, yet they could never be brought to juſtify the Divorce, with the ſubſequent Marriage that followed upon it, even after it was done: and that the King appeared very inclinable to receive their Doctrine; So ſteadily did they follow their Conſciences, even againſt their Intereſts: But the Pope was more compliant, for he offered to <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſali,</hi>

<note place="margin">The Pope's Anſwer.</note> He took notice of the Vehemence of their Stile: He freed himſelf from the Imputations of Ingratitude, and Injuſtice: He acknowledged the King's great Merits; and ſaid, he had done all he could in his Favour: He had granted a Commiſſion, but could not refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Queen's Appeal; all the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals with one conſent judged, that an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation was neceſſary. Since that time, the delays lay not at his door, but at the Kings; that he was ready to proceed, and would bring it to as ſpeedy an Iſſue, as the Importance of it would admit of; and for their Threatnings, they were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>Things being now in ſuch a Poſture,
<note place="margin">November</note> the King ſet out a Proclamation; againſt any that ſhould purchaſe, bring over, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh any Bull from <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to his Authority: and after that he made an Abſtract of all the Reaſons and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Fathers, or modern Writers, againſt his Marriage to be publiſhed, both in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The main ſtreſs was laid on the Laws in <hi>Leviticus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.</note> of the forbidden Degrees of Marriage; among which, this was one, <hi>not to marry the Brother's Wife.</hi> Theſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are called <hi>Abominations, that defile the Land;</hi> and for which, the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were caſt out of it. The Expoſition of Scripture, was to be taken from the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church; and by the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Conſent of all Doctors, thoſe Laws had been ſtill looked on as Moral, and ever binding to Chriſtians, as well as <hi>Jews:</hi> Therefore, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, adviſed <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> the Monk, upon the Converſion of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> among whom, the Marriages of the Brother's Wife were uſual, to diſſolve them, looking on them as grievous Sins: Many other Popes, as <hi>Calixtus, Zacharias,</hi> and <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, had given their Judgments, for the perpetual Obligation of thoſe Laws: They had been alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Councils of <hi>Neoceſarea, Agde,</hi> and the ſecond of <hi>Toledo.</hi> Among <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff</hi>'s condemned Opinions, this was one,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170737:48"/>that the Prohibitions of marrying in ſuch degrees, were not founded on the Law of God: For which he was condemned in ſome Engliſh Councils, and theſe were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the General Council at <hi>Conſtance.</hi> Among the Greek Fathers, both <hi>Origen, Baſil, Chryſoſtom,</hi> and <hi>Heſychius;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Latins, <hi>Tertullian, Ambroſe, Jerome,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> do formerly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this, as the belief of the Church in their time, that thoſe Laws were Moral, and ſtill in force: <hi>Anſelm, Hugo de ſancto Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctore, Hildebert,</hi> and <hi>Ivo,</hi> argue very fully to the ſame purpoſe, the laſt particularly, writing concerning the King of <hi>France,</hi> who had married his Brothers Wife, ſays, it was inconſiſtent with the Law of God, with which none can diſpence; and that he could not be admitted to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, till he put her away. <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and all the School-men, follow theſe Authorities, and in their way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, they argue fully for this Opinion; and all that writ againſt <hi>Wickliff,</hi> did alſo aſſert the Authority of thoſe Prohibitions; in particular, <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> whoſe Books were approved by Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the Fifth. All the Canoniſts did alſo agree with them, as <hi>Johannes Andreas, Panormitan,</hi> and <hi>Oſtien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis;</hi> ſo that Tradition being the only ſure Expounder of the Scripture, the Caſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed clear. They alſo proved, that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent without Conſummation, made the Marriage compleat, which being a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that which followed after in the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170737:48"/>Right of Marriage, was not neceſſary to make it compleat, as a Prieſt ſaying Maſs conſummates his Orders, which yet were compleat without it. Many Teſtimonies were brought to confirm this; from which it was inferred that the Queen's being marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> tho nothing had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed upon it, made her incapable of a lawful Marriage with the King. And yet they ſhewed what violent Preſumptions there were of Conſummation, which was all that in ſuch Caſes was ſought for, and this was expreſſed both in the Bull and Breve, tho but dubiouſly in the one, yet very poſitively in the other. After that they examined the Validity of the Pope's Diſpenſation. It was a received Maxime, that tho the Pope had Authority to diſpenſe with the Laws of the Church, yet he could not diſpenſe with the Laws of God, which were not ſubject to him: And it had been judged in the <hi>Rota</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> when a Diſpenſation was asked for a King to marry his Wives Siſter, that it could not be granted; and when Precedents were alledged for it, it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the Church was to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Laws, and not by Examples, and if any Pope had granted ſuch Diſpenſation, it was either out of Ignorance or Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This was not only the Opinion of the School-men, but of the Canoniſts, tho they are much ſet on raiſing the Pope's Power, as high as is poſſible: And therefore <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the third, refuſed to grant a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in a like caſe, tho the Parent had
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170737:49"/>ſworn to make his Son marry his Brother's Widow; others went further, and ſaid, The Pope could not diſpenſe with the Laws of the Church, which ſeveral ancient Popes had declared againſt, and it was ſaid, that the <hi>fulneſs of Power,</hi> with which the Pope was veſted, did only extend to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Care, and was not for Deſtruction, but for Edification; and that as St. <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſed St. <hi>Peter</hi> to his Face, ſo had mnay Biſhops withſtood Popes, when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt the Canons of the Church. So both <hi>Laurence</hi> and <hi>Dunſtan</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> had proceeded to Cenſures; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pope's Authority interpoſed to the contrary; and no Authority being able to make what was a Sin in it ſelf become law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; every Man that found himſelf engaged in a ſinful courſe of Life, ought to forſake it; and therefore the King ought to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the Queen, and the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> in caſe of refuſal ought to proceed to Cenſures. Upon the whole matter, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was that upon which all the Writers of Controverſy, particularly now in the Conteſts with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> founded the Doctrine of the Church, as being the only infallible Expoſition of the doubtful parts of Scripture; and that being ſo clear in this matter, there ſeemed to be no room for any further Debate.</p>
               <p>On the other hand,
<note place="margin" type="runSum">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</note> 
                  <hi>Cajetan</hi> was the firſt Writer, that againſt the ſtream of former Ages thought that the Laws of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> were only Judiciary Precepts, binding the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170737:49"/>
                  <hi>Jews,</hi> and were not moral: his Reaſons were, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children muſt have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Degrees there forbidden. <hi>Jacob</hi> married two Siſters; and <hi>Judah,</hi> according to cuſtom, gave his two Sons, and promiſed a third to the ſame Woman. <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Brother to marry the Brother's Wife when he died without Iſſue. But a Moral Law is for ever, and in all Caſes binding; and it was alſo ſaid, that the Pope's power reached even to the Laws of God, for he diſpenſed with Oaths and Vows; and as he had the Power of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Controverſies, ſo he only could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what Laws were moral and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, and what were not; nor could any Biſhops pretend to judg concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his Power, or the validity of his Bulls.</p>
               <p>To all this, thoſe that writ for the King, anſwered, That it was ſtrange to ſee Men who pretended ſuch Zeal againſt Hereticks, follow their Method, which was to ſet up private reaſonings from ſome Texts of Scripture, in oppoſition to the received Tradition of the Church, which was the bottom in which all good Catholicks thought themſelves ſafe; and if <hi>Cajetan</hi> wrote in this manner againſt the received Doctrin of the Church in one Particular, why might not <hi>Luther</hi> take the ſame liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in other Points? They alſo made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in moral Laws, between thoſe that were ſo from the nature of the thing which was indiſpenſable, and could in no
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170737:50"/>Caſe be lawful; and to this ſort, no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but thoſe of Parents and Children, could be reduced; other Moral Laws were only grounded upon publick Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Diſhoneſty, ſuch as the other Degrees were; for the Familiarities that Perſons ſo nearly related live in, are ſuch, that unleſs a Terrour were ſtruck in them, by a perpetual Law againſt ſuch mixtures, Families would be much defiled: But in ſuch Laws, tho God may grant a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in ſome particular Caſes, yet an Inferiour Authority cannot pretend to it: and ſome Diſpenſations granted in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages, ought not to be ſet up to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the Deciſions of ſo many Popes, and Councils againſt them, and the Doctrine taught by ſo many Fathers and Doctors in former times.</p>
               <p>Both ſides having thus brought forth the ſtrength of their Cauſe; it did evidently appear, That according to the Authority given to Tradition in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the King had clearly the Right on his ſide, and that the Pope's Party did write with little ſincerity in this matter, being guilty of that manner of arguing from Texts of Scriptures, for which they had ſo loudly charged the <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queen continued firm to her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, of leaving the matter in the Pope's Hands, and therefore would heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to no Propoſitions that were made to her, for referring the matter to the Arbitration of ſome choſen on both ſides.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:170737:50"/>
               <p>A Seſſion of Parliament followed in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1531"/> in which the King made the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of the Univerſities, and the Books that were written for the Divorce,
<note place="margin">A Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> be firſt read in the Houſe of Lords, and then they were carried down by Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> and 12 Lords, both of the Spirituality, and Temporality, to the Commons. There were twelve Seals of Univerſities ſhewed, and their Deciſions were read, firſt in Latin, and then Tranſlated into Engliſh. There were alſo an hundred Books ſhewed, written on the ſame Argument: Upon the ſhewing theſe, the Chancellor deſired them to report in their Countries, that they now clearly ſaw, that the King had not attempted this matter of his meer will and pleaſure, but for the diſcharge of his Conſcience, and the ſecurity of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Crown. This was alſo brought into the Convocation, who declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves ſatisfied, concerning the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of the Marriage: but the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances they were then in, made that their Declaration was not much conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for they were then under the laſh. All the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> were ſued, as in the caſe of a <hi>Premunire,</hi> for having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged a Forreign Juriſdiction, and taken out Bulls, and had Suits in the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Court.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>England</hi> did claim ſuch a Power in Eccleſiaſtical matters,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Laws of</hi> England <hi>againſt Bulls from</hi> Rome.</note> as the Roman Emperours had exerciſed before the fall of that Empire: Anciently they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170737:51"/>had by their Authority divided Biſhopricks, granted the Inveſtitures, and made Laws, both relating to Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes &amp; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. When the Popes began to extend their Power, beyond the Limits aſſigned them by the Canons, they met with great oppoſition in <hi>England,</hi> both in the matter of Inveſtitures, Appeals, Legates, and the other Branches of their Uſurpations; but they managed all the Advantages they found, either from the Weakneſs, or ill Circumſtances of Princes, ſo ſteadily, that in Concluſion, they ſubdued the World: And if they had not by their cruel Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo oppreſſed the Clergy, that they were driven to ſeek Shelter under the Covert of the Temporal Authority, the World was then ſo over-maſtered by Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Credulity, that not only the whole Spiritual Power, but even the Temporal Power of Princes, was likely to have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the Pope's hands: But the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Clergy ſupported the Secular Power, as much as they had before advanced the Papal Tyranny. <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8th, had raiſed his Pretentions to that impudent pitch, that he declared, all Power, both Eccleſiaſtical, and Civil, was derived from him, and eſtabliſhed that, as an Article of Faith, neceſſary to Salvation; and he, and his Succeſſors, took upon them, to diſpoſe of all Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, by their Bulls and Proviſions. Upon which, Laws were made in <hi>England,</hi> reſtraining thoſe Invaſions on the Crown; ſince thoſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170737:51"/>were made for informing the People of the Law of God, and for Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and Acts of Charity, which were defeated,
<note place="margin">25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1</note> as well as the Crown was diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited by the Proviſions which the Popes granted. Therefore they condemned them for the future, but no Puniſhment being declared for the Tranſgreſſors of that Fact, the Courtiers at <hi>Rome</hi> were not frighted at ſo general a Law; ſo theſe Abuſes were ſtill continued: But in <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's time,
<note place="margin">25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3</note> a more ſevere Law was made, by which, all that tranſgreſſed were to be impriſoned, to be fined at pleaſure, and to forfeit all their Benefices. By an other Act, they were put out of the King's Protection. Several other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations of this were made, both in that Reign, and under <hi>Richard</hi> the Second; and the former Puniſhments were extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only to the Proviſors themſelves, but to all that were imployed by them, or took Farms of them: and becauſe Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might be granted by the King for Aliens, to hold Benefices in <hi>England,</hi> he did bind himſelf to grant none: Others took both Preſentations in <hi>England,</hi> and obtained Proviſions from <hi>Rome,</hi> which was likewiſe condemned. The Right of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fentations was tried, only in the King's Courts; but the Popes had a mind to take the Cognizance of that to their own Courts; upon which, the Parliament conſidering the great Prejudice the Nation was like to ſuffer, and the Subjection that the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170737:52"/>Crown would fall under, reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide effectual Remedies; ſo all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons declared, they would live and die with the King,
<note place="margin">16. <hi>Ric.</hi> 2.</note> and deſired him to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all the Lords, whether they would uphold the Regality of the Crown. The Temporal Lords declared, they would do it: But the Spiritual Lords made ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; yet in Concluſion, they alſo promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they would adhere to the Crown: So a Law paſſed, that if any purchaſed, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, Excommunications, or Bulls, from <hi>Rome,</hi> that were contrary to the King, or his Crown, they, and all that brought them over, or that received, or executed them, were declared to be out of the King's Protection, and that their Goods and Chattels ſhould be forfeited to the King, and their Perſons impriſoned. And becauſe the Proceedings upon this, were by a Writ, called, from the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Words of it, <hi>Premunire facias;</hi> this Statute carried the name of the Statute of <hi>Premunire.</hi> There was alſo a Law paſſed in <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth's Reign, againſt ſome Bulls, which the <hi>Ciſtertians</hi> had procured, and againſt the high Rates ſet on Bulls in the Apoſtolick Chamber; and whereas the King had been prevailed with, to give Licences for ſome Bulls, by which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſors put the Incumbents out of their Benefices, theſe were all declared to be of no force, when done in prejudice of the Subjects Rights. The Invaſions that both the Popes and Kings made upon Elections,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170737:52"/>were by another Law condemned, and the Liberty of Elections was again ſet up. But thoſe Kings being more concerned to preſerve their own Prerogative, than the Rights of their People, were often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with, to grant Pardons, and Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to thoſe who obtained Proviſions at <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo theſe were all again condemned in <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth's time.</p>
               <p>In all this time,
<note place="margin">4. <hi>Hen.</hi> 5.</note> the weakneſs of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, gave Princes ſome Advantages, which they had not in former Ages; for a great while the Popes ſate at <hi>Avignion,</hi> where they were much eclipſed of their former Greatneſs: After that a Schiſm followed between the Popes that ſate at <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe that ſtill ſate at <hi>Avignion;</hi> and the Princes of Chriſtendom, being then at liberty, to chooſe which of thoſe they would acknowledg; the Popes durſt not thunder againſt thoſe Laws, as they had done in former times, upon much leſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation. And indeed all the uſe that the Kings made of them, was, to oblige the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſors to come and depend on them for their Licence to execute their Bulls; and the King's Authority being joyned with the Popes, it was hard for thoſe who were oppreſſed to reſiſt that double force: Nor was there any vigorous Execution made of thoſe Laws, otherwayes than to draw Mony from the Proviſors: For it fell out in this caſe, what is ordinary on all ſuch occaſions, that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites make uſe of good Laws; by which, Power is truſted to the Prince, for the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170737:53"/>Protection and Security of the Subjects, only for their own ends. It was a ſtrange weakneſs in the Princes of Chriſtendom, to take ſuch pains as was done at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> for healing the Breach in the Papacy, for while that continued, they reigned in peace; and the Clergy was leſs oppreſſed than formerly: But that being once made up, the Popes were beginning again to raiſe their old Pretentions: And Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the 5th, not being willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with ſo high ſpirited a King, as <hi>Henry</hi> the 5th was, he took Advantage in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth's Reign,
<note place="margin">6. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.</note> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Repeal of thoſe Laws, and firſt wrote very ſeverely to <hi>Chichely,</hi> then Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for not oppoſing the Statute of Proviſors, that had paſſed in the former Reign; nor ſtanding up for the Rights of St. <hi>Peter:</hi> He therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him to imitate his Predeceſſor, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Becket;</hi> and required him to declare at the next Parliament, the unlawfulneſs of it; and that all who obeyed it, were under Excommunication: He alſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to order the Clergy, to preach every where againſt it. Yet <hi>Chichely</hi> did not proceed ſo zealouſly as the Pope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and therefore he ſuſpended his Legatine Power. The Archbiſhop appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this from the Pope, to the next Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, or if none met, to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of God: But the Pope wrote alſo to the Clergy, requiring them to do what in them lay, for the repeal of the Statute:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170737:53"/>And in another Letter to the two Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops; in which, in ſpite to <hi>Chicheley, York</hi> is firſt named; he annulled the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes made by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second; and declared all to be excommunicated that executed them, reſerving the abſolution of them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, unleſs they were at the point of death: And he required them to publiſh, and affix this his Monitory Brief. The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop humbled himſelf to the Pope; and got the other Biſhops, and the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to write in his Favour to him; which they did, according to the flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and vain ſtile of that Age: In his own Letter he ſays, he had not opened the Pope's Brief, and ſo did not know what it contained, being required by the King to bring it to him with the Seals intire. The Pope wrote alſo both to the King and Parliament, requiring them, under the pains of Excommunication, and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to repeal thoſe Statutes.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1427"/> Upon the meeting of the next Parliament, the Archbiſhop, accompanied by ſeveral Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Abbots, went to the Houſe of Commons, and made them a long Speech, in the form of a Sermon, upon that Text, <hi>Render unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſars, and to God the things that are Gods;</hi> And exhorted them to repeal thoſe Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope's power, in granting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſors; and with Tears laid out the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that would follow, if the Pope ſhould proceed to Cenſures. But the Commons
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170737:54"/>would not repeal thoſe Laws; yet they were left as dead Letters among the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, for no care was taken to execute them. The Pope was ſo far ſatisfied with <hi>Chichely</hi>'s behaviour, that he received him again to favour, and reſtored to him the Legatine Power. This being hitherto mentioned by none of our Writers, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no impertinent Digreſſion to give this account of it.</p>
               <p>Now were thoſe long forgotten Statutes revived,
<note place="margin">The Clergy ſued in a Premunire</note> to bring the Clergy into a Snare: It was deſigned by the terrour of this, to force them into an intire Submiſſion; and to oblige them to redeem themſelves by the grant of a conſiderable Subſidy. They pretended they had erred ignorantly; for the King by his favour to the Cardinal, ſeemed to conſent, if not to encourage that Authority which he then exerciſed: It was a publick Errour, and ſo they ought not to be puniſhed for it. To all this it was anſwered, that the Laws which they had tranſgreſſed, were ſtill in force, and ſo no Ignorance could excuſe the Violation of them. The Convocation of <hi>Canterbury</hi> made their Submiſſion, and in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the King, he was called <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and Supream Head of the Church of England;</hi> but ſome excepting to that, it was added, <hi>in ſo far as it is agreeable to the Law of Chriſt.</hi> This was ſigned by Nine Biſhops, Fifty Abbots and Priors, and the greateſt part of the Lower Houſe; and with it they offered the King a Subſidy,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170737:54"/>to procure his Favour, of an 100000 <hi>l.</hi> and they promiſed for the future, not to make nor execute, any Conſtitutions, without his Licence. The Convocation of <hi>York</hi> did not paſs this ſo eaſily; they excepted to the word <hi>Head,</hi> as agreeing to none but Chriſt: Yet the King wrote them a long expoſtulating Letter, and told them, with what Limitations thoſe of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had paſſed that Title; upon which they alſo ſubmitted, and offered him 18840 <hi>l.</hi> which was alſo well received; and ſo all the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy were again received into the King's Protection, and pardoned. But when the King's Pardon was brought into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the Laity complained, that they were not included within it; for many of them were alſo obnoxious on the ſame account, in ſome meaſure, having had Suits in the Legatine Court; and they did apprehend, that they might be brought in trouble: And therefore they addreſſed to the King, and deſired to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended within it: But the King told them, his mercy was neither to be reſtrained, nor forced. This put the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in great trouble; but they paſt the Act: And ſoon after, the King ſent a Pardon to all his Temporal Subjects, which was received with great Joy; and they acknowledged, that the King had temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Greatneſs with his Clemency, in his way of proceeding in this matter.</p>
               <p>In this Seſſion, one <hi>Rouſe,</hi> that had poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned a great Pot of Porridge, in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170737:55"/>of <hi>Rocheſter</hi>'s Kitchin, of which two had died, and many had been brought near Death,
<note place="margin">A Poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of Treaſon.</note> was attainted of Treaſon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be boiled to death; and that was made the Puniſhment of Poiſoning in time to come. By this Act the Parliament made a Crime to be Treaſon that was not ſo before, and puniſhed the Perſon accordingly: which was founded on the Power reſerved in the 25th of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d to Parliaments, to declare in time coming what Crimes were Treaſon. This ſevere Sentence was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in <hi>Smithfield; Rouſe</hi> accuſing none as his Complices, tho malicious Perſons did afterwards impute that Action of his to a deſign of <hi>Anne Bolleyn</hi> upon <hi>Fiſher</hi>'s Life; but his ſilence under ſo terrible a Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſhewed he could not charge others with it.</p>
               <p>After the Seſſions of Parliament,
<note place="margin">The King departs from the Queen.</note> new Applications were made to the Queen to perſwade her to depart from her Appeal; but ſhe remained fixed in her Reſolution, and ſaid, ſhe was the King's lawful Wife, and would abide by it till the Court at <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould declare the contrary. Upon that the King deſired her to chuſe any of his Houſes in the Country to live in, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to ſee her more.</p>
               <p>The Clergy were now raiſing the Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<note place="margin">A Tumult among the Clergy.</note> and the Biſhops intended to make the inferiour Clergy pay their ſhare: But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s calling ſome few of them together, on whom he hoped to prevail, and make them ſet a good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170737:55"/>to the reſt, all the Clergy hearing of it, came to the Chapter-houſe and forced their way in, tho the Biſhop's Officers did what they could by Violence to keep them out. The Biſhop made a Speech, ſetting forth the King's Clemency, in accepting ſuch a Subſidy inſtead of all their Benefices, which they had forfeited to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired them to bear their ſhare in it patiently. They anſwered that they had not meddled with the Cardinal's Faculties, nor needed they the King's Pardon, not having tranſgreſſed his Laws; and therefore ſince the Biſhops and Abbots only were in fault, it was reaſonable that they only ſhould raiſe the Subſidy. Upon this the Biſhop's Officers, and They came to very high Words, and it ended in Blows: But the Biſhop quieted them all he could with good Words, and diſmiſſed them with a Promiſe that none ſhould be brought unto queſtion for what had been then done; yet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to <hi>More</hi> of it, and he put many of them in Priſon: But the thing was let fall.</p>
               <p>This Year produced a new Breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Pope and the Emperour;
<note place="margin">The Pope turns to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> the Pope pretended to <hi>Modeno</hi> and <hi>Regio</hi> as Fiefs of the Papacy; but the Emperour judged againſt him for the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> Upon this the Pope reſolved to unite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and <hi>Francis,</hi> to gain him more entirely, propoſed a Match between his ſecond Son <hi>Henry,</hi> and the Pope's Neece, the famous <hi>Catherine de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici;</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:170737:56"/>which as it wrought much on the Pope's Ambition, ſo it was like to prove a great ſupport to his Family. <hi>Francis</hi> alſo offered to reſign all his Pretentions in <hi>Italy</hi> to his Son <hi>Henry,</hi> which was like to draw in other Princes to a League with him, who would have been much better pleaſed to ſee a King's younger Son among them, than either the Emperour or the King of <hi>France.</hi> The King's Matter was now in a fairer way of being adjuſted; for the Pope's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience being directed by his Intereſts, ſince he had now broken with the Emperour, it was probable he would give the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. He ſaw the danger of loſing <hi>England.</hi> The Intereſt of the Clergy was much ſunk, and they were in a great meaſure ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the Crown. <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> was alſo making a great Progreſs, and the Pope was out of any danger from the Emperour, on whom the whole Power of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire was now fallen, drawn in, as was believed, by the Practices of <hi>Francis</hi> at the <hi>Port,</hi> tho that did not well agree with his Title of <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King.</hi> The Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> took Advantage from this, to make the Emperour conſent to ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liberty in matters of Religion, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves; they were then alſo entered into a League with <hi>Francis,</hi> for preſerving the Rights of the Empire, unto which King <hi>Henry</hi> was invited. All this raiſed <hi>Francis</hi> again very high; ſo he was the fitteſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to mediate an Agreement between the King and the Pope, and being himſelf a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170737:56"/>Lover of Pleaſure, he was the more eaſily engaged to ſerve the King in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of his Amours.</p>
               <p>A new Seſſion of Parliament was held,
<note place="margin">A miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Houſe of Commons.</note> in which the Laity complained of the ſpiritual Courts, of their way of proceeding <hi>ex Officio,</hi> and not admitting Perſons accuſed to their Purgation. But this was not much conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, by reaſon of an ill underſtanding that fell in between the King and the Houſe of Commons. There was a Cuſtom brought in of making ſuch Settlements of Eſtates, that the Heir was not liable to Wards, and the other Advantages to which the King or the Great Lords had otherwiſe a Right by their Tenures: So a Bill for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating that was ſent down by the Lords, but the Commons rejected it, which gave the King great Offence; upon that they addreſſed to the King for a Diſſolution, ſince they had been now obliged to a long At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance. The King anſwered them ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He ſaid, they had rejected a Bill, in which he had offered a great Abatement of that which he might claim by Law; and therefore he would execute the Law in its utmoſt ſeverity. He told them he had Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience while his Suit was in dependence, and ſo they muſt have likewiſe. For this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was made up of Men very ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the Clergy, ſo the King kept it ſtill in being, to terrify the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo much the more.</p>
               <p>All that was remarkable that paſt in this Seſſion was an Act againſt Annats;
<note place="margin">An Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats.</hi>
                  </note> it ſets
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170737:57"/>forth that they were founded on no Law, they were firſt enacted to defend Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom againſt Infidels, and were now kept up as a Revenue to the Papacy, and Bulls were not granted till they were compounded for: for 800000 Ducats had bin carried out of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> on that account ſince the beginning of the former Reign. The King was bound by his Royal Care of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to hinder ſuch Oppreſſions; and therefore all that were provided to great Benefices, were required not to pay <hi>Firſt Fruits</hi> for the future, under the pain of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting all their Goods, and the profits of their Benefices; and thoſe that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to Biſhopricks were appointed to be conſecrated, tho their Bulls were denied at <hi>Rome,</hi> and they were required to pay no more but 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of the clear Profits of their Sees. If the Pope ſhould upon this proceed to cenſures, they required all the Clergy to perform Divine Offices, theſe notwithſtanding. But by an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Proviſo, they referred it to the King to declare at any time between that and Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter next, whether this Act ſhould take place or not: and the King by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents declared that it ſhould take place being provoked by the Pope.</p>
               <p>In <hi>January</hi> the Pope,
<note place="margin">The Pope writes to the King.</note> upon the motion of the Imperialiſts wrote to the King, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that notwithſtanding a Suit was depending concerning his Marriage, yet he had put away his Queen, and kept one <hi>Anne</hi> as his Wife, contrary to a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170737:57"/>ſerved on him; therefore he exhorted him to live with his Queen again, and to put <hi>Anne</hi> away. Upon this the King ſent Dr. <hi>Bennet</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> with a large Diſpatch;
<note place="margin">The King's Anſwer.</note> in it he complained that the Pope proceeded in that matter upon the Suggeſtion of others, who were ignorant and raſh Men: the Pope had carried himſelf inconſtantly and deceitfully in it, and not as became Chriſt's Vicar: and the King had now for ſeveral Years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a Remedy from him in vain. The Pope had granted a Commiſſion, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed never to recal it, and had ſent over a Decretal Bull defining the Cauſe. Either theſe were unjuſtly granted, or unjuſtly recalled. If he had Authority to grant theſe things, where was the Faith which became a Friend, much more a Pope, ſince he had recalled them? If he had not Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to grant them, he did not know how far he could conſider any thing he did. It was plain that he acted more with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Intereſts, than according to Conſcience; and that, as the Pope had often confeſſed his own Ignorance in theſe matters, ſo he was not furniſhed with Learned Men to adviſe him, otherwiſe he would not maintain a Marriage which almoſt all the Learned Men and Univerſities in <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> had condemned as unlawful. He deſired the Pope would excuſe the Freedom he uſed, to which his Carriage had forced him. He would not queſtion his Authority, unleſs he were compelled to it, and would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but reduce it to its firſt and ancient Limits, which was much better than to let high
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170737:58"/>it run on headlong, and ſtill do amiſs. This high Letter made the Pope reſolve to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and end this matter, either by a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or a Treaty. The King was cited to anſwer to the Queen's Appeal at <hi>Rome</hi> in Perſon, or by Proxy: ſo Sir <hi>Edward Karme</hi> was ſent thither in the new Character of the King's Excuſator, to excuſe the King's Appearance, upon ſuch grounds as could be founded on the Canon Law,
<note place="margin">The King cited to <hi>Rome,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> and upon the Privileges of the Crown of <hi>England. Bonner</hi> that was a forwad and ambitious Man, and would ſtick at nothing that might contribute to his Preferment, was ſent over with him. The Imperialiſts preſſed the Pope much to give Sentence, but all the wiſe Cardinals, who obſerved by the Proceedings of the Parliament, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would adhere to the King, if he ſhould be provoked to ſhake off the Pope's Yoke, were very apprehenſive of a Breach, and ſuggeſted milder Counſels to the Pope; and the King's Agents aſſured him, that if he gave the King content, the late Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Annats,</hi> ſhould not be put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Ravenna</hi> was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an Oracle for Learning in the Conſiſtory,
<note place="margin">Some Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</note> ſo the King's Agents reſolved to gain him with great Promiſes; but he ſaid, Princes were liberal of their Promiſes, till their turn was ſerved, and then forgot them; ſo he reſolved to make ſure work; therefore he made <hi>Bennet</hi> give him a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in writing of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Ely,</hi> or the firſt Biſhoprick that fell till that was
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170737:58"/>vacant, and he alſo engaged that the King ſhould procure him Benefices in <hi>France</hi> to the value of 6000 Ducats a Year, for the Service he ſhould do him in his Divorce. This was an Argument of ſo great Efficacy with the Cardinal, that it abſolutely tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him from being a great Enemy, to be as great a Promoter, of the King's Cauſe, tho very artificially. Several other Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals were alſo prevailed with, by the ſame Topicks. The King's Agents put in his Plea of Excuſe in 28 Articles, and it was orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that three of them ſhould be diſcuſſed at a hearing before the Conſiſtory, till they ſhould be all examined: But that Court ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting once a Week, the Imperialiſts, after ſome of them were heard, procured an Order, that the reſt ſhould be heard in a Congregation or Committee of Cardinals, before the Pope, for greater Diſpatch: but <hi>Karn</hi> refuſed to obey this, and ſo it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred back to the Conſiſtory. But againſt this the Imperialiſts proteſted, and refuſed to appear any more. News were brought to <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>England,</hi> that a Prieſt that had preached up the Pope's Power, was caſt into Priſon; and that one committed by the Archbiſhop for Hereſy, appealed to the King as ſupream Head, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and judged in the King's Courts. The Pope made great Complaints upon this: but the King's Agents ſaid, the beſt way to prevent the like for the future, was to do the King Juſtice. At this time a Bull was granted for ſuppreſſing ſome Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170737:59"/>and erecting new Biſhopricks out of them. <hi>Cheſter</hi> was to be one, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Revenna</hi> was ſo pleaſed with the Revenue deſigned for it,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1542"/> that he laid his hand upon it, till <hi>Ely</hi> ſhould happen to fall vacant. In concluſion, the Pope ſeemed to favour the King's Plea Excuſatory, upon which the Imperialiſts made great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. But this amounted to no more, ſave that the King was not bound to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Perſon: Therefore the Cardinals that were gained, adviſed the King to ſend over a Proxy for anſwering to the merits of the Cauſe, and not to loſe more time in that Dilatory Plea; and they having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves againſt the King in that Plea, before the bargain had been made with them, could with the better credit ſerve him in the other. So the Vacation coming on, it was reſolved by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals neither to admit nor reject the Plea. But both the Pope and the Colledg wrote to the King to ſend over a Proxy for deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the matter next Winter. <hi>Bonner</hi> was alſo ſent to <hi>England</hi> to aſſure the King, that the Pope was now ſo much in the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, that he might confidently refer his matter to him; but whereas the King deſired a Commiſſion to judg <hi>(in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus)</hi> upon the place: it was ſaid, that the Point to be judged, being the Pope's Authority to diſpenſe with the King's Marriage, that could not be referred to Legates, but muſt needs be judged in the Conſiſtory.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:170737:59"/>
               <p>At this time a new Seſſion of Parliament was called in <hi>England.</hi> The Clergy gave in an Anſwer to the Complaints made of them by the Commons in the former Seſſions:
<note place="margin">A Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> But when the King gave it to the Speaker, he complained that one <hi>Temſe,</hi> a Member of their Houſe, had moved for an Addreſs to the King, that the Queen might be again brought back to the Court; The King ſaid, it touched his Conſcience, and was not a thing that could be determined in that Houſe. He wiſhed his Marriage were good, but many Divines had declared it unlawful. He did not make his Suit out of Luſt or fooliſh Appetite, being then paſt the Heats of Youth; he aſſured them, his Conſcience was troubled, and deſired them to report that to the Houſe. Many of the Lords came down to the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and told them, the King intended to build ſome Forts on the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſecure the Nation from the Inroads of the <hi>Scots;</hi> and the Lords ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of this, ſent them to propoſe it to the Commons, upon which a Subſidy was voted; but upon the breaking out of the Plague, the Parliament was prorogued, before the Act was finiſhed.
<note place="margin">The Oaths which the Biſhops ſwore both to the Pope and the King.</note> At that time the King ſent for the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, and told him he found that the Prelates were but half Subjects; for they ſwore at their Conſecration an Oath to the Pope, that was inconſiſtent with their Allegiance, and Oath to the King. By their Oath to the Pope, they ſwore
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170737:60"/>to be in no Council againſt him, nor to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe his Secrets; but to maintain the Papacy, and the Regalities of S.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1522"/> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> againſt all Men; together with the Rights and Authorities of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that they ſhould honourably entreat the Legats of the Apoſtolick See, and obſerve all the Decrees, Sentences, Proviſions, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of that See; and yearly, either in Perſon or by Proxy, viſit the Threſholds of the Apoſtles. In their Oath to the King, they renounced all Clauſes in their Bulls contrary to the King's Royal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and did ſwear to be faithful to him, and to live and die with him againſt all others, and to keep his Counſel; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that they held their Biſhopricks only of him. By theſe it appeared that they could not keep both thoſe Oaths, in caſe a Breach ſhould fall out between the King and the Pope. But the Plague broke off the Conſultations of Parliament at this time. Soon after, Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Rupture with <hi>Rome</hi> coming on ſo faſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>More</hi> quits his Office.</note> deſired leave to lay down his Office, which was upon that conferred on Sir <hi>Tho. Audley.</hi> He was ſatisfied with the King's keeping up the Laws formerly made in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Papal Incroachments, and ſo had concured in the Suit of the <hi>Premunire;</hi> but now the matter went further, and ſo he not being able to keep pace with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, returned to a private Life, with a Greatneſs of Mind equal to what the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans</hi> had expreſſed on
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170737:60"/>ſuch Occaſions. Endeavours were uſed to faſten ſome Imputations on him, in the Diſtribution of Juſtice;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1533"/> but nothing could be brought againſt him, to blemiſh his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</p>
               <p>An Enterveiw followed between the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> to which,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King of</hi> France, &amp; England.</note> 
                  <hi>Ann Bolleyn,</hi> now Marchioneſs of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> was carried; In which, after the firſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and Magnificence was over, <hi>Francis</hi> promiſed <hi>Henry</hi> to ſecond him in his Suit: He encouraged him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a ſecond Marriage, without more adoe; and aſſured him, he would ſtand by him in it: And told him, he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reſtrain the payment of Annats to <hi>Rome;</hi> and would ask of the Pope a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of that and other Grievances; and if it was denied, he would ſeek other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies in a Provincial Council. An En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview was propoſed between the Pope and Him; to which he deſired the King go with him; and King the was not unwilling to it, if he could have aſſurance that his Buſineſs would be finally determined. The Pope offered to the King, to ſend a Legate to any indifferent place out of <hi>England,</hi> to form the Proceſs, reſerving only the giving Sentence to himſelf: And propoſed to him, and all Princes, a General Truce, that ſo he might call a General Council. The King anſwered, that ſuch was the preſent State of the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> that it was not ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to call a General Council; that it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170737:61"/>was contrary to his Prerogative to ſend a Proxy to appear at <hi>Rome;</hi> That by the Decrees of General Councils,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1530"/> all Cauſes ought to be judged on the place, and by a Provincial Council; and that it was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to judge it in <hi>Engiand,</hi> than any where elſe: And that by his Coronation Oath, he was bound to maintain the Dignities of his Crown, and the Rights of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and not to appear before any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Court: So Sir <hi>Thomas Elliot</hi> was ſent over with Inſtructions, to move, that the cauſe might be judged in <hi>England:</hi> Yet if the Pope had real Intentions of giving the King full Satisfaction, he was not to inſiſt on that: And to make the Cardinal of <hi>Ravenna</hi> ſure, he ſent him the offer of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nov. 14. <hi>The King marries</hi> Ann Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn.</note> then vacant. Soon after this, the King mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Ann Bolleyn; Rowland Lee</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Biſhop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield</hi>) did officiate, none being preſent but the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and her Father, her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and her Brother, and <hi>Cranmer.</hi> It was thought, that the former Marriage being null of it ſelf, the King might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to another: And perhaps, they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that as the Pope had formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this Method, ſo he would now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it. But tho the Pope had joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to <hi>France,</hi> yet he was ſtill ſo much in fear of the Emperour, that he reſolved not to provoke him; and ſo was not wrought on by any of the Expedients which <hi>Bennet</hi> propoſed, which were either
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170737:61"/>to judge the Cauſe in <hi>England,</hi> according to the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> or to refer it to the Arbitration of ſome,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1532"/> to be named by the King, and the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Pope: for all theſe, he ſaid, tended to the Diminution of the Papal Power. A new Citation was iſſued out, for the King, to anſwer to the Queen's Complaints; but the King's Agents proteſted, that he was a Soveraign Prince, that <hi>England</hi> was a free Church, over which the Pope had no juſt Authority; and that the King could expect no Juſtice at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Power was ſo great.</p>
               <p>At this time, the Parliament met again,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1533"/> and paſt an Act,
<note place="margin">

               <p>There was now a new Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cranmer <hi>made Archbiſhop of</hi> Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> 
                  <hi>Warham</hi> died the former Year: He was a great Patron of Learning, a good Canoniſt, and wiſe States-man; but was a cruel Perſecutor of Hereticks, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe Fanatical Stories. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> was then in <hi>Germany,</hi> diſputing in the King's Cauſe with ſome of the Emperour's Divines. The King reſolved to advance him to that Dignity; and ſent him word of it, that ſo he might make haſte over: But a Promotion ſo far above his Thoughts, had not its common Effects on him: He had a true and primitive Senſe of ſo great a Charge; and inſtead of aſpiring to it, he was afraid of it, &amp; he both returned very ſlowly to <hi>England,</hi> and uſed all his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, to be excuſed from that Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But this declining of Preferment, being a thing, of which the Clergy of that Age were ſo little guilty, diſcovered, That he had Maximes very far different from moſt Church-men. Bulls were ſent for to <hi>Rome,</hi> in order to his Conſecration, which the Pope granted, tho it could not be very grateful to him, to ſend them to one who had ſo publickly diſputed againſt his Power of diſpenſing; all the Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was payed for them, was, but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170737:62"/>900 Ducats, which was perhaps accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Regulation, made in the Act againſt Annats. There were 9 ſeveral Bulls ſent over, one, confirming the King's No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; a Second, requiring him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it; a Third, abſolving him from Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; a Fourth, to the Suffragan Biſhops; a Fifth, to the Dean and Chapter; a Sixth, to the Clergy; a Seventh, to the Laity; an Eighth, to the Tenants of the See, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring all theſe to receive him to be their Archbiſhop; a Ninth, requiring ſome Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to conſecrate him; the Tenth gave him the Pall; and by the Eleventh, the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> was required to put it on him. The putting all this in ſo many different Bulls, was a good Contrivance, for raiſing the Rents of the Apoſtolick Chamber. On the 30 of <hi>March, Cranmer</hi> was conſecrated by the Biſhops of <hi>Lincoln, Exeter,</hi> and St. <hi>Aſaph.</hi> The Oath to the Pope was of hard Digeſtion: So he made a Proteſtation before he took it, that he conceived himſelf not bound up by it in any thing, that was contrary to his Duty to God, to his King, or Country; and he repeated this when he took it; ſo that if this ſeemed too artificial for a Man of his ſincerity; yet he acted in it fairly,

               <p>The Convocation had then two Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions before them; the firſt was, Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lawfulneſs of the King's Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and the Validity of the Pope's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; the other was, of Matter of Fact, Whether P. <hi>Arthur</hi> had conſummated the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170737:63"/>Marriage, or not. For the firſt, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of 19 Univerſities were read; and after a long Debate,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1519"/> there being 23 only in the Lower Houſe, 14 were againſt the Marriage, and 7 for it, and two voted du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biouſly. In the upper Houſe, <hi>Stokeſly,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Fiſher,</hi> maintained the Debate long; the one for the Affirmitive, and the other the Negative: At laſt it was carried, <hi>Nemine contradicente,</hi> (the few that were of the other ſide it ſeems with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing) againſt the Marriage, 216 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent. For the other, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned matter of Fact, it was referred to the Canoniſts; and they all, except five or ſix, reported, That the Preſumptions were violent; and theſe in a matter not capable of plain proof, were alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Law. The ſmal number in the Lower, and the far greater number in the upper Houſe of Convocation, makes it probable, that then, not only Biſhops, but all Abbots, Priors, Deans, and Arch-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, ſate in the upper Houſe, for they were all called <hi>Prelates,</hi> and had their Writs to ſit in a General Council, as appears by the Records of the fourth Council in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> and the Council at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and ſo them might well ſit in the upper Houſe: And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the two Houſes of Convocation, were taken from the Patern of the two Houſes of Parliament, and ſo none might ſit in the lower Houſe, but ſuch as were choſen to repreſent the Inferiour Clergy.

               <p>The Convocation having thus judged in the matter, the Ceremoy of pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divorce judicially, was now only wanting. The new Queen began to have big a Belly, which was a great Evidence of her living chaſtly before that with the King. On Eaſter Eve ſhe was declared Queen of <hi>England.</hi> And ſoon after, <hi>Cranmer,</hi> with <hi>Gardiner</hi> (who was made upon <hi>Wolſey</hi>'s death Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>) and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>London, Lincoln, Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> with many Divines and Canoniſts, went to <hi>Dunſtable;</hi> Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> living then near it, at <hi>Ampthil.</hi> The King and Queen were cited; he appeared by Proxy, but the Queen refuſed to take any notice of the Court: So after three Citations, ſhe was declared <hi>Contumax,</hi> and all the Merits of the Cauſe formerly mentioned, were examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. At laſt, on the 23 of <hi>May,</hi> Sentence was given, declaring the Marriage to have been null from the beginning. Among the Archbiſhops Titles in the beginning of the Judgment, he is called, <hi>Legate of the Apoſtolick See,</hi> which perhaps was added to give it the more force in Law. Some days after this, he gave another Judgment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the King's Marriage with Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> and on the firſt of <hi>June</hi> ſhe was Crowned Queen: This was variouſly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured. It was ſaid,
<note place="margin">Cenſures paſt upon it.</note> that in the Intervals of a General Council, the asking the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170737:64"/>of ſo many Univerſities, and Learned Men, was the only ſure way to find out the Tradition of the Church: And a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Council had ſufficient Authority to judge in this Caſe: Yet many thought, the Sentence diſſolving the firſt Marriage, ſhould have preceded the ſecond: And it being contracted, before the firſt was Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally annulled, there was great colour given to queſtion the Validity of it. But it was anſwered, That ſince the firſt was judged null of it ſelf, there was no need of a Sentence Declaratory, but only for form: Yet it was thought, either there ought to have been no Sentence paſt at all, or it ſhould have been before the ſecond Marriage. Some objected, That <hi>Cranmer</hi> having appeared ſo much againſt the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, was no competent Judge; but it was ſaid, that as Popes are not bound by the Opinions they held when they were private Men; ſo he having changed his Character, could not be challenged on that account, but might give Sentence, as Judges decide Cauſes, in which they formerly gave Counſel: And indeed, the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had judged the Cauſe, he only gave Sentence in form of Law. The World wondered at the Pope's Stiffneſs; but he often confeſſed, he underſtood not thoſe matters, only he was afraid of provoking the Emperour; or of giving the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> advantage to ſay, that one Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned that, with which another had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed. All People admired Q. <hi>Ann</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170737:64"/>who in a courſe of ſo many Years managed a King's Spirit, that was ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, in ſuch a manner, as neither to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit him with too many Favours, nor to provoke him with too much Rigour; and her being ſo ſoon with Child, gave hopes of a mumerous Iſſue: They that loved the Reformation, lookt for better dayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Protection; but many Prieſts, and Friars, both in Sermons and Diſcourſes, condemned the King's Proceedings. The King ſent Ambaſſadours to all Courts, to juſtify what he had done: He ſent alſo ſome to Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> to charge her to aſſume no other Title, but that of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Dowager;</hi> and to give her hopes of puting her Daughter next in the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Crown, after his Iſſue by the preſent Queen, if ſhe would ſubmit her ſelf to his Will, but ſhe would not yield; ſhe ſaid, ſhe would not take that Infamy on her ſelf; and ſo reſolved, that none ſhould ſerve about her, that did not treat her as Queen. All her Servants adhered ſo to her Intereſt, that no Threatnings nor Promiſes, could work on them: And the ſtir which the King kept in this matter, was thought below his Greatneſs, and ſeemed to be ſet on by a Woman's Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for ſince ſhe was deprived of the Majeſty of a Crown, the Pageantry of a Title was not worth the noiſe that was made about it. The Emperour ſeemed big with Reſentments. The French King was colder then the King expected; yet
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170737:65"/>he promiſed to intercede with the Pope, and the Cardinals, on his account: But he was now ſo entirely gained by the Pope, That he reſolved not to involve himſelf in the King's Quarrel, as a Party: And he alſo gave over the Deſigns he once had of ſetting up a Patriarch in <hi>France;</hi> for the Pope granted him ſo great a Power over his own Clergy, that he could not deſire more. With this the Emperour was not a little pleaſed; for this was like to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thoſe two Kings, whoſe Conjunction had been ſo hurtful to him.</p>

But inſtead of putting the matter paſt reconciling, there was only Sentence given, annulling all that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had done; and the King was required under the pain of Excommunication, to put things again in the ſtate in which they were formerly; and this was affixed at <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> The King ſent a great Embaſſy to <hi>Francis,</hi> who was then ſetting out to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> where the Pope was to meet him: Their Errand was to diſſwade him from the Journey, unleſs the Pope would promiſe to give the King Satisfaction: The King of <hi>France</hi> ſaid, he was engaged in Honour to go on; but aſſured them, he would mind the King's Concerns, with as much Zeal, as if they were his own.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170737:66"/>him into a Cauldron of melted Lead, or burning him alive: And he apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome danger fled away privately. But when <hi>Francis</hi> came back to <hi>Paris,</hi> he ſent over the Biſhop of that City, to the King, to let him know what he had obtained of the Pope in his Favours, and the Terms on which it was promiſed: This wrought ſo much on the King, that he preſently conſented to them. And upon that, the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> tho it was now in the middle of Winter, took Journey to <hi>Rome;</hi> being ſure of the Scarlet, if he could be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of regaining <hi>England,</hi> which was then upon the point of being loſt: What theſe Aſſurances were which the Pope gave, is not certain; but the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Tenſtal</hi> of <hi>Dureſm,</hi> in a Letter which they wrote on that Occaſion, ſay, that the Pope ſaid at <hi>Marſeilles, That if the King would ſend a Proxy to</hi> Rome, <hi>he would give Sentence for him againſt the Queen, for he knew his Cauſe was good and juſt.</hi> Upon the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi>'s coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> the matter ſeemed agreed; for it was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that upon the King's ſending a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe under his hand, to put things in their former ſtate; and his ordering a Proxy to appear for him, Judges ſhould be ſent to <hi>Cambray</hi> for making the Proceſs, and then Sentence ſhould be given. Upon the notice given of this, and of a Day that was prefixt for the return of the Courier, the King diſpatched him with all poſſible haſt; and now the Buſineſs ſeemed at an end. But
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170737:66"/>the Courier had a Sea and the <hi>Alps</hi> to paſs, and in Winter it was not eaſy to obſerve a limited day ſo exactly: This made that he came not to <hi>Rome</hi> on the prefixed day; upon which, the Imperialiſts gave out, that the King was abuſing the Pope's Eaſineſs; ſo they preſt him vehemently to proceed to a Sentence: The Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only for a delay of ſix days, which was no unreaſonable time in that Seaſon, and in favours of ſuch a King, who had a Suit depending ſix Days, and ſince he had Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ſo many Years; the delay of a few days was no extraordinary Favour. But the deſign of the Imperialiſts was, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Reconciliation: for if the King had been ſet right with the Pope, there would have been ſo powerful a League formed againſt the Emperour, as would have broke all his Meaſures: And therefore it was neceſſary for his Deſignes to imbroil them. It was alſo ſaid, That the King was ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Delayes, and Conceſſions, meerly to delude the Pope; and that he had proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far in his Deſign againſt that See, that it was neceſſary to go on to Cenſures: And the angry Pope was ſo provoked by them, and by the News that he heard out of <hi>England,</hi> that without conſulting his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Prudence, he brought in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Conſiſtory; and there the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts being the greater number, it was driven on with ſo much Precipitation, that they did in on day that, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Form, ſhould have been done in three.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:170737:67"/>
               <p>They gave the final Sentence, declaring, the King's Marriage with Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> good; and required him to live with her as his Wife,

                  </note> otherwiſe they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Cenſures. Two days after that, the Courier came with the King's Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in due form: He alſo brought earneſt Letters from <hi>Francis,</hi> in the King's Favours. This wrought on all the indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cardinals, as well as thoſe of the French Faction. So they praied the Pope to recall what was done. A new Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory was called, but the Imperialiſts preſt with greater Vehemence then ever, that they would not give ſuch Scandal to the World, as to recall a definitive Sentence paſt, of the validity of a Marriage; and give the Hereticks ſuch Advantages by their unſteadineſs in matters of that nature: And ſo it was carried, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sentence ſhould take place; and the Execution of it was committed to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. When this was known in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it determined the King in his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, of ſhaking off the Pope's Yoke, in which he had made ſo great a Progreſs, that the Parliament had paſt all the Acts concerning it, before he had the News from <hi>Rome:</hi> For he judged, that the beſt way to Peace was, to let them at <hi>Rome</hi> ſee, with what vigour he could make War.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170737:68"/>the Pope for a General Council. The other Priviledges aſcribed to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> were either only a precedence of Order, or were occaſioned by his Fall, as that, <hi>Feed my Sheep,</hi> it being a reſtoring him to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Function. St. <hi>Peter</hi> had alſo a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Province, the Circumciſion, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> had the Uncircumciſion, that was of far greater extent; which ſhewed that he was not conſidered as the Univerſal Paſtor. In the Primitive Church, St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> and other Biſhops, wrote to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to their fellow Biſhop, Colleague and Brother: they were againſt Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> and did not ſubmit to their Definition, and in plain Terms aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that all Biſhops were equal in Power as the Apoſtles had been. It is true, the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the City made the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> to be much eſteemed; yet in the firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> were declared to have the ſame Authority in the Countries about them, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> had over thoſe that lay about them. It is true, the Eaſt being over-run with <hi>Arrianiſm,</hi> from which the Weſt was better preſerved, the oppreſſed Eaſtern Biſhops did take ſhelter in the Protection the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> gave them; and, as is natural to all People, they magnified that Authority which was ſo uſeful to them. But the ſecond General Council indirectly condemned all Appeals to <hi>Rome:</hi> for it decreed that every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ſhould be governed by its own Synod,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170737:68"/>and allowed no higher Appeal but to the Biſhops of the Dioceſs. <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the Imperial City, the ſecond and fourth General Council gave it equal Priviledges with <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe it was <hi>new Rome:</hi> which ſhews that the Dignity of the Sees flowed from the greatneſs of the Cities. The <hi>African</hi> Churches condemned all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Popes, who complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of that, pretended only to a Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> for it; and then they did not talk of a Divine Right; but ſearch being made into all the Copies of the Canons of the Council, that was found to be a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery.

It is true <hi>Boniface</hi> the third got the ſame Title by <hi>Phocas</hi>'s Grant, and <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth pretended to all Power both ſpiritual and temporal; but the Progreſs of their Uſurpations, and the Wars raiſed to maintain them, were very viſible in Hiſtory. The Popes ſwore at their Conſecrations to obey the Canons of the eighth firſt General Councils, which are manifeſted againſt Appeals and their Univerſal Juriſdiction; ſmall regard is to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170737:69"/>be had to the Decrees of latter Councils, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cabals pack'd and managed as the Popes pleaſed. Several Sees, as <hi>Ravenna, Milan,</hi> and <hi>Aquileia</hi> pretended Exemption from the Papal Authority. Many Engliſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had aſſerted that the Popes had no Authority againſt the Canons, and to that day no Canon the Popes made was binding till it was received; which ſhewed the Pope's Authority was not believed founded on a divine Authority: and the Conteſts that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had with the Pope's concerning Inveſtitures, Biſhops doing the King Homage, Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Authority of Papal Bulls and Proviſions, ſhewed that the Pope's Power was believed ſubject to Laws and Cuſtom, and ſo not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Chriſt and St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and as Laws had given them ſome Power, and Princes had bin forced in ignorant Ages to ſubmit to their Uſurpations, ſo they might as they ſaw cauſe change thoſe Laws, and reſume their Rights.</p>
               <p>The next Point inquired into was,
<note place="margin">And for the King's Supremacy</note> the Authority that Kings had in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the Church. The King of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> judged in all Cauſes, and <hi>Samuel</hi> called <hi>Saul</hi> the <hi>Head of the Tribes. David</hi> made many Rules about the Service at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and declaring to <hi>Solomon</hi> what his Power was,
<note place="margin">1 Chron. 28.21. 2 Chron. 8.14, 15.</note> he told him that the <hi>Prieſts were wholly at his Command;</hi> and it is alſo ſaid, that <hi>Solomon appointed the Prieſts their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Service of God, and that they departed not from his Commandment in any matter;</hi> he turned out one High-Prieſt, and put another
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170737:69"/>in his room. <hi>Jehoſhaphat, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Joſias,</hi> made alſo Laws about Eccleſiaſtical Matters. In the New Teſtament, Chriſt was himſelf ſubject to the Civil Powers, and charged his Diſciples not to affect Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Dominion. They alſo wrote to the Churches to be ſubject to the Higher Powers, and call them <hi>Supream,</hi> and charge every Soul to be ſubject to them: ſo in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the King is called <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Supream,</hi> and <hi>every Soul</hi> is ſaid to be under him, which joyn'd together, makes up this Concluſion, that <hi>He is the ſupream Head over all Perſons.</hi> In the Primitive Church the Biſhops only made Rules or Canons, but pretended to no compulſive Authority, but what came from the Civil Magiſtrate. The Roman Emperours called Councils, preſided in them, and confirmed them; and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Laws concerning Eccleſiaſtical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; ſo did alſo <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. The Emperours did alſo either chuſe the Popes themſelves, or confirm their Elections. Church-men taking Orders, were not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſcharged from the Obedience they formerly owed their Princes, but remained ſtill Subjects. And tho the Offices of the Church had peculiar Functions, in which the People were ſubject to them, that did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from their Obedience to the King, as a Father's Authority over his Children cuts not off the King's Power over him. They found alſo that in all times the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had aſſumed an Authority in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Matters. <hi>Ina, Alfred, Edgar,</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:170737:70"/>and <hi>Canetus,</hi> had made many Laws about them; ſo had alſo moſt of the Kings ſince the Conqueſt, which appeared particularly in the Articles of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and the Conteſts that followed upon them; and from the daies of King <hi>Ina,</hi> they had granted Exemptions to Monaſteries from the Epiſcopal Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, down to <hi>William</hi> the Conquerors time: beſides many other Acts that clearly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported a Supremacy over all Perſons, and in all Cauſes. But they did at the ſame time ſo explain and limit this Power, that it was viſible they did not intend to ſubject Religion wholly to the Pleaſure of the King; for it was declared that his Power was only a Coercive Authority, to defend the true Religion, to aboliſh Hereſies and Idolatries, to cauſe Biſhops and Paſtors to do their Duties, and in caſe they were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, or would not amend their Faults, to put others in their room. Upon the whole matter, they concluded that the Pope had no Power in <hi>England,</hi> and that the King had an intire Dominion over all his Subjects, which did extend even to the regulating of Eccleſiaſtical Matters.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being fully opened in many Diſputes,
<note place="margin">The Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it.</note> and publiſhed in ſeveral Books, all the Biſhops, Abbots, and Priors of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Fiſher</hi> only excepted, were ſo far ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with them, or ſo much in love with their Preferments, that they reſolved to comply with the Changes which the King was reſolved to make. <hi>Fiſher</hi> was in great eſteem for Piety and ſtrictneſs of Life, and ſo
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170737:70"/>much pains was taken on him. A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament met, <hi>Cranmer</hi> propoſed to him, that he, and any five Doctors he would chooſe, and <hi>Stokeſly</hi> with five on his ſide, ſhould confer on that point, and examine he Authorities that were on both ſides; he accepted of it, and <hi>Stokeſly</hi> wrote to him to name time and place, but <hi>Fiſher</hi>'s Sickneſs hindered the Progreſs of that motion.</p>
               <p>The Parliament met the 15th of <hi>January,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> there were but ſeven Biſhops and twelve Abbots preſent, the reſt it ſeems were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to concur in making this change, tho they complied with it when it was made. Every Sunday during the Seſſion, a Biſhop preached at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Pope had no Authority in <hi>England:</hi> Before this, they had only ſaid that a General Council was above him, and that the Exactions of that Court, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to it, were unlawful; but now they went a ſtrain higher, to prepare the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for receiving the Acts then in Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. On the 9th of <hi>March,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Pope's Power ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</note> the Commons began the Bill for taking away the Pope's Power, and ſent it to the Lords on the 14th, who paſt it on the 20th without any diſſent. In it they ſet forth the Exactions of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">grounded on the Pope's Power of diſpenſing; and that as none could diſpenſe with the Laws of God; ſo the King and Parliament only had the Authority of diſpenſing with the Laws of the Land; and that therefore ſuch Licenſes or Diſpenſations as were
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170737:71"/>formerly in uſe, ſhould be for the future granted by the two Arch-biſhops, ſome of theſe were to be confirmed under the Great Seal; and they appointed that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after all Commerce with <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould ceaſe. They alſo declared that they did not intend to alter any Article of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith of Chriſtendome, or of that which was declared in the Scripture neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation. They confirmed all the Exemptions granted to Monaſteries by the Popes, but ſubjected them to the King's Viſitation; and gave the King and his Council power to examine and reform all Indulgences and Priviledges granted by the Pope: The Offenders againſt this Law were to be puniſhed according to the Statutes of <hi>Premunire.</hi>
                  </q> This Act ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Monaſteries entirely to the King's Authority and put them in no ſmall Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Thoſe that loved the Reformation, rejoyced both to ſee the Pope's Power rooted out, and to find the Scripture made the Standard of Religion.</p>
               <p>After this Act,
<note place="margin">The Act of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</note> another paſt in both Houſes in ſix Days time, without any Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <q rend="inline">Settling the Succeſſion of the Crown; confirming the Sentence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, and the King's Marriage with Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and declaring all Marriages within the Degrees prohibited by <hi>Moſes</hi> to be unlawful: All that had married within them were appointed to be divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and their Iſſue illegitimated; and the Succeſſion to the Crown was ſettled
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170737:71"/>upon the King's Iſſue, by the prefent Queen, or in default of that, to the King's right Heirs, for ever. All were required to ſwear, to maintain the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of this Act; and if any refuſed to ſwear to it, or ſhould ſay any thing to the Slander of the King's Marriage, he was to be judged guilty of miſpriſion of Treaſon, and to be puniſhed accordingly.</q> The Oath is alſo ſet down in the Journals of the Houſe of Lords; by which, they did not only ſwear Obedience to the King, and his Heirs, by his preſent Marriage; but alſo to defend the Act of Succeſſion, and all the Effects and Contents in it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all manner of Perſons whatſoever; by which they were bound to maintain the Divorce, both againſt the Pope's Cenſures, and the Emperour, if he went about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute them.</p>
               <p>At this time,
<note place="margin">An Act regulating the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</note> one <hi>Philips</hi> complained to the Houſe of Commons of the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> for uſing him cruelly in Priſon, upon Suſpicion of <hi>Hereſy;</hi> the Commons ſent up this to the Lords, but received no Anſwer: So they ſent ſome of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the Biſhop, deſiring him to anſwer the Complaints put in againſt him: But he acquainted the Houſe of Lords with it; and they all with one conſent voted, that none of their Houſe ought to appear, or anſwer to any Complaint at the Bar of the Houſe of Commons. So the Commons let this particular Caſe fall, and ſent up a Bill to which the Lords agreed, regulating
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170737:72"/>the Proceedings againſt Hereticks, <q rend="inline">That whereas, by the Statute made by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, Biſhops might commit Men upon Suſpition of <hi>Hereſy;</hi> and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy was generally defined, to be what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was contrary to the Scriptures, or <hi>Canonical Sanctions,</hi> which was liable to great Ambiguity; therefore that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was repealed, and none were to be committed for Hereſy, but upon a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment made by two Witneſſes: None were to be accuſed for ſpeaking againſt things that were grounded only upon the Pope's Canons. Bail was to be taken for Hereticks, and they were to be brought to their Trials in open Court; and if upon Conviction, they did not abjure, or were Relapſes, they were to be burnt; the King's Writ being firſt obtained.</q> This was a great check to the Biſhop's Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany, and gave no ſmal comfort to all that favoured the Reformation.</p>
               <p>The Convocation ſent in a Submiſſion at the ſame time,
<note place="margin">The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Clergy.</note> by which they acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That all Convocations ought to be aſſembled by the King's Writ; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed upon the <hi>Word of Prieſts,</hi> never to make, nor execute any Canons, without the King's Aſſent. They alſo deſired, That ſince many of the received Canons were found to be contrary to the King's Prerogative, and the Laws of the Land, there might be a Committee named by the King, of 32, the one half out of both Houſes of Parliament, and the other of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170737:72"/>Clergy, empowered to abrogate or regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them, as they ſhould ſee Cauſe. This was confirmed in Parliament,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1534"/> and the Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Appeals to <hi>Rome</hi> was renewed; and an Appeal was allowed from the Archbiſhop to the King, upon which the Lord Chancellor was to grant a Commiſſion for a Court of Delegates. A Proviſo was added, that till the Committee of 32 ſhould ſettle a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Canons, thoſe then in force ſhould ſtill take place, except ſuch as were contrary to the King's Prerogative, or the Laws. But this laſt Proviſo, tho it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reaſonable, to give the Spiritual Courts ſome Rules, till the 32 ſhould finiſh their Work, made, that it came to nothing; for it was thought more for the Greatneſs of the King's Authority; and it ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Biſhop's Courts more to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions of the Temporal Courts, to keep this whole matter in ſuch General Terms, than to have brought it to a Regulation that ſhould be fixed and conſtant.</p>
               <q>Another Act paſt,
<note place="margin">An Act for the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</note> for regulating the Elections and Conſecrations of Biſhops; condemning all Bulls from <hi>Rome;</hi> and appointing that upon a Vacancy, the King ſhould grant a Licence for an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and ſhould by a miſſive Letter ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the Perſon's Name whom he would have choſen: And within twelve Days after theſe were delivered, the Dean and Chapter, or Prior and Convent, were required to return an Election of the Perſon named by the King, under their
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170737:73"/>Seals. The Biſhop Elect was upon that to ſwear Fealty; and a Writ was to be iſſued out for his Conſecration in the uſual manner: After that, he was to do Homage to the King, upon which, both the Temporalities, and Spiritualities, were to be reſtored; and Biſhops were to exerciſe their Juriſdiction as they had done before. All that tranſgreſſed this Act, were made guilty of a premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire.</q>
               <p>A private Act paſt, depriving Cardinal <hi>Campegio,</hi> and <hi>Jerome de Ghinuccii</hi> of the Biſhopricks of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and <hi>Worceſter;</hi> the Reaſons given for it are, becauſe they did not reſide in their Dioceſſes, for Preaching the Laws of God, and keeping Hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but lived at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and carried 3000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>The laſt Act of a publick Nature,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taindor of the Nun of</hi> Kent.</note> tho relating only to private Perſons, of which I ſhall give an account, was, concerning the Nun of <hi>Kent,</hi> and her Complices: It was the firſt occaſion of ſhedding any Blood in this Quarrel, and it was much cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the Superſtitious Clergy, that adhered to the Queen's Intereſts, and the Pope's. The Nun, and many of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, came to the Lord's Bar, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the whole matter. Among the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealers of this Treaſon, Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> and <hi>Fiſher,</hi> were named; the former wrote upon that a long Letter to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> giving him a particular account of all the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170737:73"/>he had at any time with the Nun: He acknowledged he had eſteemed her highly, not ſo much out of any regard he had to her Propheſies, but for the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he conceived of her Holineſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. But he adds, that he was then convinced, <hi>That ſhe was the moſt falſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling Hypocrite that had been known; and guilty of moſt deteſtable Hypocriſy, and divelliſh diſſembled Falſhood: He alſo believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhe had Communication with an evil Spirit.</hi> Concerning this Letter, a curious Diſcovery has been made. In Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, <hi>More</hi>'s Works were publiſhed; and among them, other Letters of his to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> relating to that long one which he wrote concerning the Nun, were printed; but that was left out, of which <hi>More</hi> kept a Copy, and gave it to his Daughter <hi>Roper;</hi> that Copy was in the MS. out of which the reſt were publiſhed, and out of that I have tranſcribed it. The deſign of ſuppreſſing it, ſeems to be this: It is probable, there might have been ſome thoughts in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, to Canonize the Nun, ſince ſhe was called a Martyr for her Mother's Marriage; and there was no want of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to juſtify it: Therefore, a Letter ſo plain and full againſt her, was thought fit to be kept out of the way. This Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of <hi>Mores,</hi> prevailed ſo far, that his Name was ſtruck out of the Bill. The Act contains a Narrative of that whole Story, which is in ſhort, this;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elizabeth Barton</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> fell in ſome
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170737:74"/>Trances, (it ſeems they were Hyſterical Fits) and ſpake ſuch things as made thoſe about her think ſhe was inſpired of God. The Parſon of the Pariſh, <hi>Maſter,</hi> hoping to draw Advantages from this, gave Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Warham</hi> notice of it, who ordered him to obſerve her carefully, and bring him an account of what ſhould follow. But ſhe had forgot all that ſhe ſaid in her Fitts, when they were over: Yet the Prieſt would not let it go ſo, but perſwaded her that ſhe was inſpired, and taught her ſo to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit thoſe Trances, that ſhe became very ready at it. The matter was much noiſed about; and the Prieſt intended to raiſe the credit of an Image of the B. Virgins that was in his Church, that ſo Pilgrimages and Offerings might be made to it, by her means. He aſſociated to himſelf one <hi>Bocking,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and they taught her to ſay in her Fits, that the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her, and told her, ſhe could not be well till ſhe viſited that Image. She ſpake many good Words againſt ill Life, and ſpake alſo againſt <hi>Hereſy,</hi> and the King's Suit of Divorce then depending; and by many ſtrange motions of her Body, ſhe ſeemed to be inwardly poſſeſſed. A day was ſet for her cure; and before an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of 2000 People, ſhe was carried to that Image; and after ſhe had acted her Fitts all over, ſhe ſeemed of a ſudden quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, which was aſcribed to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Virgin, and the Virtue of that Image. She entered into a Religious Life;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170737:74"/>and <hi>Bocking</hi> was her Ghoſtly Father. There were wiolent Suſpicions of Incontinence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; but the eſteem ſhe was in, bore them down. Many thought her a Propheteſs; and <hi>Warham</hi> among the reſt. A Book was alſo written of her Revelations, and a Letter was ſhewed all in Letters of Gold; pretended to be writ to her from Heaven, by <hi>Mary Magdalene.</hi> She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that when the King was laſt at <hi>Calais,</hi> ſhe was carried inviſibly beyond Sea, and brought back again; and that an Angel gave her the Sacrament; and that God revealed to her, that if the King went on in his Divorce, and married an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Wife, he ſhould fall from his Crown, and not live a Month longer, <hi>but ſhould die a Villain's Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many of the Monks of the Charter-Houſe, and the Obſervant Friers, with many Nuns, and B. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> came to give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to this, and ſet a great value on her, and grew very inſolent upon it; for Frier <hi>Peyto</hi> preaching in the King's Chappel, at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> denounced the Judgments of God upon him; and ſaid, tho others as lying Prophets deceived him, yet he in the name of God told him, that <hi>Dogs ſhould lick his Blood as they had done</hi> Ahabs. The King bore this patiently; but ordered one Dr. <hi>Corren</hi> to preach next Sunday, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all that he had ſaid, who railed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Peyto,</hi> as a Dog and a Traitor. <hi>Peyto</hi> had gone to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but <hi>Elſton,</hi> a Franciſcan of the ſame Houſe, interrupted
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170737:75"/>him, and called him one of the lying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that went about to eſtabliſh the Succeſſion of the Crown by Adultery; and ſpoke with ſuch Vehemence, that the King himſelf was forced to command him ſilence. And yet ſo unwilling was the King to go to Extremities, that all that was done upon ſo high a Provocation, was, that they were called before the Council, and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for their Inſolence. But the Nun's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates publiſhing her Revelations in all the parts of the Kingdom, ſhe and Nine of her Complices were apprehended in <hi>November</hi> laſt Year; and they did all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Rack or Torture, diſcover the whole Conſpiracy, and upon that, were appointed to go to St. <hi>Pauls;</hi> and after a Sermon preached upon that Occaſion, by the Biſhop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> they repeated their Confeſſion, in the Hearing of the People; and were ſent to ly Priſoners in the Tower. But it was given out, That all was extorted from them by Violence; and Meſſages were ſent to the <hi>Nun,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring her, to deny all that ſhe had confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; which made the King judge it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to proceed to further Extremities. So ſhe, and ſix of her chief Complices, were Attainted of Treaſon: And the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and five more, were At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of Miſpriſion of Treaſon. But at the Interceſſion of Q. <hi>Ann,</hi> (as it is expreſt in the Act) all others that had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with her, were pardoned.</p>
               <p>This was as black an Impoſture as any
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170737:75"/>ever was; and if it had fallen out in a darker Age, in which the World went mad after Viſions, the King might have loſt his Crown by it. The Diſcovery of this, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed all to look on older Stories of the Trances of Monaſtical People, as Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to ſerve baſe ends, and did make way for the ruine of that Order of Men in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but all that was at preſent done upon it, was, that the Obſervants were put out of their Houſes, and mixt with the other <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> and the <hi>Auſtin</hi> Friers were put in their rooms. When all theſe Acts were paſſed, the King gave his Aſſent to them on the 29th of <hi>March,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued the Parliament till <hi>November.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Members of both Houſes ſwore to the Oath of Succeſſion on the day of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation. On the 20th of <hi>April,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Oath of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſworn.</note> followed the Execution of the <hi>Nun</hi> and her Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at Tyburn, where ſhe freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged her Impoſtures, and the Juſtice of the Sentence, and laid the blame on thoſe that ſuffered with her; who becauſe the thing was profitable to them, praiſed her much, and tho they knew that all was feigned, yet gave out that it was done by the working of the Holy Ghoſt; and ſhe concluded her Life, begging both God's and the King's Pardon. Upon the firſt Diſcovery of this Cheat,
<note place="margin">Fiſher <hi>in ſome Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſent <hi>Fiſher</hi>'s Brother to him to reprove him for his Carriage in that Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to adviſe him to ask the King's Pardon for the Encouragement he had given to the <hi>Nun,</hi> which he was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170737:76"/>the King would grant him. But <hi>Fiſher</hi> excuſed himſelf, and ſaid, he had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but only tried whether her Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were true or not? He confeſſed that upon the Reports he had heard, he was induced to have a high Opinion of her; and that he had never diſcovered any Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in her. It is true, ſhe had ſaid ſome things to him concerning the King's Death, which he had not revealed, but he thought it was not neceſſary to do it; becauſe he knew ſhe had told it to the King her ſelf; ſhe had named no Perſon, that ſhould kill the King, but had only denounced it as a Judgment of God on him; and he had reaſon to think that the King would have been offended with him if he had ſpoken of it to him; and ſo he deſired to be no more troubled with that matter. But upon that, <hi>Cromwell</hi> wrote him a ſharp Letter; he ſhewed him that he had proceeded raſhly in that Affair; being ſo partial in the matter of the King's Divorce, that he eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed every thing that ſeemed to make againſt it; he ſhewed him how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it was to uſe great Caution before extraordinary things ſhould be received, or ſpread about as Revelations; ſince other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Peace of the World ſhould be in the hands of every bold or crafty Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor; yet in concluſion, he adviſes him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to ask the King's Pardon for his Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and he aſſures him that the King was ready to forgive that, and every thing elſe, by which he had offended him. But <hi>Fiſher</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:170737:76"/>was obſtinate and would make no Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo included within the Act, yet it was not executed till a new Provocation drew him into further Trouble.

                  </note> to which many were cited in order to the ſwearing the Oath; among whom was Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> and <hi>Fiſher. More</hi> was firſt called on to take it: he anſwered that he neither blamed thoſe that made the Acts, nor thoſe that ſwore the Oath, and that he was willing to ſwear to maintain the Succeſſion to the Crown, but could not take the Oath as it was conceived. <hi>Fiſher</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:170737:77"/>made the ſame Anſwer, but all the reſt that were cited before them, took it. <hi>More</hi> was much preſs'd to give his Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; but he refuſed to do that, for it might be called a diſputing againſt Law: yet he would put them into Writing if the King would command him to do it. <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſaid, if he did not blame thoſe that took it, it ſeems he was not perſwaded it was a Sin, and ſo was only doubtful of it; but he was ſure he ought to obey the Law, if it was not ſinful; ſo there was a Certainty on the one hand, and only a Doubt on the other; and therefore the former ought to determine him: this he confeſſed did ſhake him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but he ſaid, he thought in his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it would be a Sin in him, and offered to take his Oath upon that, and that he was not led by any other Conſideration. The Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> told him he ought to think his Conſcience was miſled, ſince the Parliament was of another Mind; an Argument well becoming a rich ignorant Abbot. But <hi>More</hi> ſaid, if the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was againſt him, yet he believed all the reſt of Chriſtendom was on his ſide: In concluſion, both he and <hi>Fiſher</hi> declared that they thought it was in the Power of the Parliament to ſettle the Succeſſion to the Crown, and ſo were ready to ſwear to that, but they could not take the Oath that was tendred to them; for by it they muſt ſwear to maintain all the Contents in the Act of Succeſſion, and in it the King's former Marriage was declared unlawful; to which
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170737:77"/>they could not aſſent. <hi>Cranmer</hi> preſs'd that this might be accepted: for if they once ſwore to maintain the Succeſſion, it would conduce much to the Quiet of the Nation; but ſharper Counſels were more acceptable: ſo they were both committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and Pen, Ink, and Paper was kept from them. The old Biſhop was alſo hardly uſed both in his Cloaths and Diet; he had only Rags to cover him and Fire was often denied him, which was a Cruelty not capable of any Excuſe, and was as barbarous as it was imprudent.</p>
               <p>In Winter another Seſſion of Parliament was held; the firſt Act that paſs'd,
<note place="margin">Another Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the King to be the <hi>Supream Head on Earth of the Church of</hi> England, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that to be added to his other Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; and it was enacted, that he and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors ſhould have full Authority to reform all Hereſies and Abuſes in the Spiritual Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. By an other Act they confirmed the Oath of Succeſſion, which had not been ſpecified in the former Act, tho agreed to by the Lords. They alſo gave the King the firſt Fruits and Tenthes of Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, as being the Supream Head of the Church; for the King being put in the Pope's room, it was thought reaſonable to give him the Annats, which the Popes had formerly exacted. The Temporalty were now willing to revenge themſelves on the Spiritualty, and to tax them as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily as they had formerly tyrannized over them. Another Act paſt declaring ſome
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170737:78"/>things Treaſon; one of theſe was the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King any of his Titles, or the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him Heretick, Schiſmatick, or Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Crown. By another Act, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was made for ſetting up 26 Suffragan Biſhops over <hi>England,</hi> for the more ſpeedy Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and the better Service of God: It is alſo ſaid, they had been formerly accuſtomed to be in the Kingdom: The Biſhop of the Dioceſs was to preſent two to the King, and upon the King's declaring his choice, the Archbiſhop was to conſecrate the Perſon, and then the Biſhop was to delegate ſuch parts of his Charge to his Care as he thought fitting, which was to laſt during his Pleaſure. Theſe were the ſame that the Ancients cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> who were at firſt the Biſhops of ſome Villages; but were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put under the Juriſdiction of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the next City. They were ſet up before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and continued to be in the Church for many Ages; but the Biſhops devolving their whole Spiritual Power to them, they were put down, and a Decretal Epiſtle was forged in the name of <hi>P. Damaſus,</hi> condemning them. The great Extent of the Dioceſſes in <hi>England</hi> made it hard for one Biſhop to govern them with that Exactneſs that was neceſſary; theſe were therefore appointed to aſſiſt them in the diſcharge of the Paſtoral Care.</p>
               <p>In this Parliament Subſidies were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted payable in three Years, with the higheſt Preamble of their Happineſs under the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170737:78"/>King's Government all thoſe 24 Years, in which he had reigned, that Flattery could dictate. <hi>Fiſher</hi> and <hi>More</hi> by two ſpecial Acts were attainted of Miſpriſion of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; five other Clerks were in like manner condemned, all for refuſing to ſwear the Oath of Succeſſion. The See of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> was declared void; yet it ſeems few were willing to ſucceed ſuch a Man, for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued vacant two Years. This Severity againſt them was cenſured by ſome as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, ſince they were willing to ſwear to the Succeſſion in other Terms, ſo that it was merely a point of Conſcience, in which the common Safety was not concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at which they ſtuck, and it was thought the proſecuting them in this manner would ſo raiſe their Credit, that it might endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Government more than any Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which they could make.</p>
               <p>But now that the King entered upon a new Scene,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the New Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines made in</hi> England.</note> it will be neceſſary to open the Progreſs that the new Opinions had made in <hi>England</hi> all the time of the King's Suit of Divorce. During <hi>Wolſey</hi>'s Miniſtry, thoſe Preachers were gently uſed; and it is probable the King ordered the Biſhops to give over their enquiring after them, when the Pope began to uſe him ill; for the Progreſs of Hereſy was always reckoned up at <hi>Rome</hi> among the Miſchiefs that would follow upon the Pope's denying the King's Deſires. But <hi>More</hi> coming into Favour, he offered new Counſels; he thought the King's proceeding ſeverely againſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170737:79"/>would be ſo meritorious at <hi>Rome,</hi> that it would work more effectually, than all his Treatnings had done: ſo a ſevere Proclamation was iſſued out both againſt their Books and Perſons, ordering all the Laws againſt them to be put in Execution. <hi>Tindall</hi> and ſome others at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> were every Year either tranſlating or writing Books againſt ſome of the received Errors, and ſending them over to <hi>England.</hi> But his Tranſlation of the New Teſtament gave the greateſt Wound, and was much complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of by the Clergy, as full of Errors. <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall</hi> then Bp of <hi>London</hi> being a Man of great Learning and Vertue, which is generally accompanied with much Moderation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the Treaty of <hi>Cambray,</hi> to which <hi>More</hi> and he were ſent in the King's Name, as he came through <hi>Antwerp,</hi> dealt with an Engliſh Merchant that was ſecretly a Friend of <hi>Tindall</hi>'s, to procure him as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his New Teſtaments as could be had for Mony. <hi>Tindall</hi> was glad of this; for being about a more correct Edition, he found he would be better enabled to ſet about it, if the Copies of the Old were ſold off; ſo he gave the Merchant all he had, and <hi>Tonſtall</hi> paying the Price of them, got them in his hands; and burnt them publickly in <hi>Cheapſide.</hi> This was called a burning of the Word of God; and it was ſaid the Clergy had reaſon to revenge themſelves on it, for it had done them more Miſchief than all other Books whatſoever. But a Year after this, the ſecond Edition being
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170737:79"/>ſiniſhed, great Numbers were ſent over to <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> one of <hi>Tindall</hi>'s Partners, hapned to be taken; ſo <hi>More</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that ſome of the Merchants of <hi>London</hi> furniſhed them with Mony, promiſed him his Liberty, if he would diſcover who they were that encouraged and aſſiſted them: ſo he told him the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> did more than all the World beſides, for he had brought up the greateſt gart of a faulty Impreſſion. The Clergy when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Tindall</hi>'s Tranſlation, promiſed a new one: but a Year after in a long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of ſeveral Books that were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by <hi>Warham, Tonſtall,</hi> and other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts and Divines, they added this, that it was not neceſſary to publiſh the Scripture in Engliſh, and that the King did well not to ſet about it.</p>
               <p>There came out a Book writ by one <hi>Fiſh</hi> of <hi>Grayes-Inn,</hi> that took mightily,
<note place="margin">The Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Beggars.</note> called, the <hi>Supplication of the Beggars,</hi> by which they complained that the Alms of the People were intercepted by the Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Friars, that were an uſeleſs Burden to the Government; they alſo taxed the Pope of Cruelty, for taking no Pity on the Poor, ſince none but thoſe that could pay for it, were delivered out of Purgatory. The King was ſo pleaſed with this, that he would not ſuffer any thing to be done againſt the Author. <hi>More</hi> anſwered it by another Supplication in behalf of the Souls in Purgatory, ſetting forth the Miſeries they were in, and the Relief which they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170737:80"/>received by the Maſſes that were ſaid for them, and therefore they called on their Friends to ſupport the Religious Orders, that had now ſo many Enemies. This was elegantly and wittily written, but did not take ſo much as the other; for ſuch is the ill nature of Mankind, that Satyres are always better received than Apologies, and no Satyres are more acceptable than thoſe againſt Church-men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frith</hi> anſwered <hi>More</hi> in a Book more gravely written,
<note place="margin">Frith <hi>writes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Purgatory</hi>
                  </note> in which he ſhewed that there was no mention made of Purgatory in the Scripture, that it was inconſiſtent with the Merits of Chriſt, by which upon ſincere Repentance, all Sins were pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for if they were pardoned, they could not be puniſhed: And tho Temporary Judgments, either as Medicinal Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or for giving Warning to others, do ſometimes fall even on true Penitents; yet terrible Puniſhments in another ſtate, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt with a free Pardon, and the remembring of our Sins no more. In ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding many Paſſages of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he appealed to <hi>More</hi>'s great Friend, <hi>Eraſmus;</hi> and ſhewed, That <hi>the Fire</hi> which was ſpoken of by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as that which would conſume <hi>the Wood, Hay, and Stubble,</hi> could only be meant of the fiery Trial of Perſecution. He ſhewed, That the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church received it not; <hi>Ambroſe, Jerom,</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> did not believe it; the laſt had plainly ſaid, that no mention was made of it in Scripture. The Monks
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170737:80"/>brought it in; and by many wonderful Stories, poſſeſſed the World of the belief of it;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1533"/> and had made a very gainful Trade of it. This Book provoked the Clergy ſo much, that they reſolved to make the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor feel a real Fire, for endeavouring to extinguiſh their Imaginary one. <hi>More</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Poverty, and want of Learning, to the new Preachers: But it was anſwered, The ſame thing was made uſe of to diſgrace Chriſt and his Apoſtles; but a plain Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of mind without Artificial Improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was rather thought a good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition for Men that were to bear a Croſs; and the Glory of God appeared more Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, than the Inſtruments ſeemed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</p>
               <p>But the Pen proving too feeble,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſet on by</hi> More.</note> and too gentle a Tool, the Clergy betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that, on which they relied more: Many were vexed with Impriſonments for teaching their Children the Lord's Prayer in Engliſh, for harbouring the Preachers, and for ſpeaking againſt the Corruptions in the Worſhip, or the Vices of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; but theſe generally abjured. One <hi>Hitton,</hi> that had been a Curate, and went over to <hi>Tindall,</hi> was taken coming back with ſome Books; and was by <hi>Warham</hi> condemned and burnt.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170737:81"/>that he might be able to do that on ſurer Grounds, he followed his Studies cloſe two Years; for then he left the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and went into <hi>Norfolk</hi> where he was born, and preached up and down that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, againſt Idolatry and Superſtition; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the People to live well, to give much Almes, to believe in Chriſt, and to offer up their Souls and Wills to him in the Sacrament: He openly confeſſed his own Sin of denying the Faith; and uſing no Precaution as he went about, he was taken by the Biſhops Officers, and was condemned as a Relapſe, and degraded. <hi>More</hi> not only ſent down the Writ to burn him, but to make him ſuffer another way; he affirmed in Print that he had abjured: But no Paper ſigned by him was ever ſhewed, and little credit was due to the Prieſts who gave it out, that he did it by word of Mouth: But <hi>Parker</hi> (afterwards Archbiſhop) was an eye Witneſs of his Sufferings. He bore all the hardſhips he was put to, patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and continued very cheerful after his Sentence; and eat up the poor Proviſion that was brought him, heartily; for he ſaid, he muſt keep up a ruinous Cottage till it fell. He
<note place="margin">Iſaiah.</note> He had thoſe Words often in his Mouth, <hi>When thou walkeſt thorow the Fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt:</hi> And by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Finger in the Candle, he prepared himſelf for the Eire, and ſaid, it would only conſume the Stubble of his Body, but would purify his Soul.</p>
               <p>On the 10th of <hi>November</hi> he was burnt.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170737:81"/>At the Stake he repeated the Creed, to ſhew he was a true Chriſtian; for the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy made ſtrange Repreſentations of his Doctrine: Then he prayed earneſtly, and with a deep ſence repeated thoſe Words, <hi>Enter not into Judgment with thy Servant.</hi> Dr. <hi>Warner</hi> that waited on him, embraced him, ſhedding many Tears, and wiſhed that he might die in as good a ſtate as that in which he then was. The Friers deſired him to declare to the People, that they had not procured his Death, and he did it; ſo the laſt Act of his Life was full of Charity to his Enemies. His Sufferings Animated others. <hi>Byfield</hi> that had formerly abjured, was taken diſperſing <hi>Tindall</hi>'s Books, and one <hi>Tewkesbury,</hi> were condemned by <hi>Stokes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and burnt. Two Men and a Woman were alſo burnt at <hi>York.</hi> Upon theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, the Parliament that ſate that Year, complained to the King; but that did not cool the Heat of the Clergy. One <hi>Bainham</hi> a Councellour of the Temple, was taken on Suſpicion of <hi>Hereſy,</hi> and whipt in <hi>More</hi>'s preſence, and afterwards rackt in the Tower: Yet he could not be wrought on to accuſe any, but through Fear he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured. After that, being diſcharged, he was in great trouble of Mind, and could find no quiet till he went publickly to Church, and openly confeſſed his Sins; and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Torments he felt in his Conſcience, for what he had done. Upon this, he was again ſeized on, and condemned, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid, <q rend="inline">That <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> was a Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and was damned, if he did not repent:
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170737:82"/>And that in the Sacrament Chriſt's Body was received by Faith, and not chewed with the Teeth.</q> Sentence paſt upon him by <hi>Stokesly,</hi> and he was burnt. Soon after this, <hi>More</hi> delivered up the Great Seal, ſo the Preachers had ſome eaſe. <hi>Crome</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi> were accuſed, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured. <hi>Tracy,</hi> (Anceſtor to the preſent Lord <hi>Tracy</hi>) made a Will, by which he left his Soul to God, in hopes of Mercy through Chriſt, without the help of any other Saint; and therefore he declared, that he would leave nothing for Soul-Maſſes. This Will being brought to the Biſhop of <hi>London's</hi> Court to be proved, after his Death, provoked them ſo much, that he was condemned as an Heretick; and an Order was ſent to the Chancellour of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> to raiſe his Body; but he went further and burnt it, which could not be juſtified, ſince he was not a Relapſe. <hi>Tracy</hi>'s Heirs ſued him for it, and he was turned out of his place, and fined in 400 <hi>l.</hi> The Clergy proclaimed an Indulgence of fourty days Pardon to any that carried a Faggot to the burning of an Heretick, that ſo Cruelty might ſeem the more Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And an aged Man <hi>(Harding)</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>Longland,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> as he was tied to the Stake, one flung a Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got with ſuch force at him, that it daſhed out his Brains.</p>
               <p>After an Intermiſſion of two Years, <hi>Gardiner</hi> repreſented to the King,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1533"/> That it would give him great Advantages againſt the Pope, if he would take hold of ſome
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170737:82"/>occaſion to ſhew his hatred of <hi>Hereſy.</hi> So <hi>Frith</hi> ſeemed a fit Perſon to offer as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, to demonſtrate his Zeal: He was a young Man, much famed for Learning:
<note place="margin">Frith's <hi>Sufferings.</hi>
                  </note> and was the firſt that writ againſt the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Preſence in the Sacrament, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> He followed <hi>Zuinglius</hi>'s Doctrine on theſe Grounds; Chriſt received in the Sacrament, gave Eternal Life; but this was only to thoſe that believed; from which he inferred, that he was received only by Faith. St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, that the Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt eat the ſame Spiritual Food with Chriſtians; from which it appears, that Chriſt is now no more corporally preſent to us then he was to them: And he argued from the nature of Sacraments in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the ends of the Lord's Supper, that it was only a Commemoration. Yet upon theſe Premiſes, he built no other Concluſion but that Chiſt's preſence was no Article of Faith. <hi>Frith</hi> put theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Writing, which falling into <hi>More</hi>'s hands, was anſwered by him; but <hi>Frith</hi> never ſaw that till he was put in Priſon: And then, tho he was loaded with Irons, and had no Books allowed him, he replied. He inſiſted much on that Argument, That the Iſraelites did eat the ſame Food, and drank of the <hi>ſame Rock, that was Chriſt;</hi> and ſince Chriſt was only myſtically, and by Faith received by them; he concluded, that he was now received only by Faith. He ſhewed, that Chriſt's Words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> were accommodated to the Jewiſh Phraſe of calling the Lamb <hi>the Lord's Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over;</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:170737:83"/>and confirmed his Opinion with many Paſſages out of the Fathers; in which, the Elements were called <hi>Signes</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of Chriſt's Body; and they ſaid that upon Conſecration they did not ceaſe to be Bread and Wine, <hi>but remained ſtill in their own proper Natures.</hi> He alſo ſhewed, That the Fathers were Strangers to all the Conſequences of that Opinion, as that a Body could be in more places than one at once, or could be in a place after the manner of a Spirit: Yet he concluded, That if that Opinion were held only as a Speculation; ſo that Adoration were not offered to the Elements, it might be well tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, but that he condemned as groſs Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. This was intended by him to prevent ſuch Heats in <hi>England,</hi> as were raiſed in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Helveti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> by reaſon of their different Opinions concerning the Sacrament. He was ſeized on in <hi>May</hi> 1533, and brought before <hi>Stokes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Gardiner,</hi> and <hi>Longland.</hi> They object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him his not believing Purgatory, nor Tranſubſtantiation: He gave his Reaſons that determined him to look on neither of theſe as Articles of Faith; but he thought that neither the affirming nor denying them ought to be determined poſitively. The Biſhops ſeemed unwilling to proceed to Sentence; but he continuing reſolute, <hi>Stokesly</hi> pronounced it; and ſo delivered him to the Secular Arm, obteſting, that his Puniſhment might be moderated, ſo that the Rigour might not be too extream; nor yet the gentleneſs of it too much mitigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170737:83"/>This Obteſtation by the Bowels of Chriſt, was thought a Mockery; when all the World knew that it was intended that he ſhould be burnt. One <hi>Hewet,</hi> a Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>London,</hi> was alſo condemned with him, on the ſame account. When they were brought to <hi>Smithfield, Frith</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed great Joy, and hugged the Faggots with ſome Tranſport: <hi>Cook,</hi> a Prieſt, that ſtood by, called to the People not to pray for them more then they would do for a Dog. <hi>Frith</hi> ſmiled at that, and prayed God to forgive him: The Fire was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which conſumed them to aſhes. This was the laſt Inſtance of the Cruelty of the Clergy at this time; for the Act, formerly mentioned, regulating their Proceedings, followed ſoon after. <hi>Philips,</hi> at whoſe Complaint, that Bill was begun, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon Suſpicion of Hereſy; a Copy of <hi>Tracy</hi>'s Will was found about him, and Butter and Cheeſe being alſo found in his Chamber in Lent: But he being required to abjure, appealed to the King as <hi>Supream Head,</hi> and upon that he was ſet at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but whether he was tried by the King or not, is not upon Record.</p>
               <p>The Act that was paſt,
<note place="margin">A ſtop put to further Cruelties.</note> gave the new Preachers and their Followers, ſome Reſpite. The King was alſo impowered to reform all Hereſies, and Idolatries: And his Affairs did now oblige him to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite himſelf to the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> that by their means, he might ſo imbroil the Emperour's Affairs, asnot to give him
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170737:84"/>leiſure to turn his Arms againſt <hi>England;</hi> and this produced a ſlackning of all Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities againſt them: For thoſe Princes, in that firſt fervour of the Reformation, made it an Article in all their Treaties, that none ſhould be perſecuted for favouring their Doctrine.
<note place="margin">The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers had at Court.</note> The Queen did alſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly protect them; ſhe took <hi>Latimer,</hi> and <hi>Shaxton</hi> to be her Chaplains, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to the Biſhopricks of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Salisbury. Cranmer</hi> was fully convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the neceſſity of a Reformation, and that he might carry it on with true Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and juſtify it by good Authorities, He made a great Collection of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Antient Fathers, and later Doctors, in all the Points of Religion; of which I have ſeen two Volumes in Folio: But by a Letter of the Lord <hi>Burghly</hi>'s, it appears, there were then ſix Volumes of his Collections in his hands. He was a Man of great Candor, and much Patience and Induſtry; and ſo was on all accounts well prepared for that Work, to which the Providence of God did now call him: And tho he was in ſome things too much ſubject to the King's Imperious Temper, yet in the matter of the ſix Articles, he ſhewed that he wanted not the Courage that became a Biſhop in ſo Critical an Affair as that was. <hi>Cromwel</hi> was his great and conſtant Friend; a man of mean Birth, but of excellent Qualities, as appeared in his adhering to his Maſter <hi>Wolſey,</hi> after his fall; a rare Demonſtration of Gratitude
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170737:84"/>in a Court, to a diſgraced Favourite: And in his greateſt height, he happening to ſee a Merchant of <hi>Lucca,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1534"/> who had pitied and relieved him when he was in <hi>Italy,</hi> but did not ſo much as know him, or pretend to any returns for the ſmall Favours he had formerly ſhewed him, and was then redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a low condition, treated him with ſuch acknowledgments, that it became the Subjects of ſeveral Pens, which ſtrove who ſhould celebrate it moſt.</p>
               <p>As theſe ſet themſelves to carry on a Reformation,
<note place="margin">Others op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it much.</note> there was another Party formed that as vigourouſly oppoſed it, headed by the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi> and almoſt all the Clergy went into it. They perſwaded the King that nothing would give the Pope or the Emperour ſuch Advantages, as his making any Changes in Religion; and it would reflect much on him, if he who had writ ſo learnedly for the Faith, ſhould in ſpite to the Pope make any Changes in it. Nothing would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage other Princes ſo much to follow his Example, nor keep his Subjects ſo much in their Duty to him, as his continuing ſtedfaſt in the Antient Religion. Theſe things made great Impreſſions on him. But on the other hand, <hi>Cranmer</hi> repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him that if he rejected the Pope's Authority, it was very abſurd to let ſuch Opinions or Practices continue in the Church, that had no other Foundation but Papal Decrees: and therefore he deſired that this might be put to the Trial, he
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170737:85"/>ought to depend on God, and hope for good Succeſs if he proceeded in this matter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Duty of a Chriſtian Prince. <hi>England</hi> was a compleat Body within its ſelf; and tho in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, when united under one Prince, General Councils were eaſily aſſembled, yet now that was not to be ſo much depended on; but every Prince ought to reform the Church in his Dominions by a National Synod; and if in the Antient Church ſuch Synods condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Hereſies, and reformed Abuſes, that might be much more done, when <hi>Europe</hi> was divided into ſo many Kingdoms. It was viſible that tho both the Emperour and the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> had for 20 Years deſired a Ceneral Council, it could not be obtained of the Pope; he had indeed offered one at <hi>Mantua,</hi> but that was only an Illuſion.</p>
               <p>Upon that the Kiug deſired ſome of his Biſhops to give their Opinion concerning the Emperour's Power of calling Councils:
<note place="margin">The Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of a General Council.</note> So <hi>Cranmer, Tonſtall, Clark</hi> of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and <hi>Goodrick</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> made anſwer, That tho Ancient Councils were called by the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, yet that was done by reaſon of the Extent of their Monarchy, that was now ceaſed, but ſince other Princes had an entire Monarchy within their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. Yet if one or more of thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould agree to call a Council to a good Intent, and deſire the Concurrence of the reſt, they were bound by the Rule of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to agree to it: They were alſo of Opinion that none but Biſhops and Prieſts
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170737:85"/>had Right to a definitive Voice in matters of Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cranmer</hi> alſo made a long Speech at that time,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heads of a Speech of</hi> Cranmers.</note> ſetting forth the neceſſity of a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. It is probable it was in the Houſe of Peers, for it begins; <hi>My Lords</hi> — <q rend="inline">He begun with the Impoſtures and Deceit uſed by the Canoniſts and other Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at <hi>Rome.</hi> Then he ſpeak to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a General Councils; he ſhewed that it flowed not from the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Biſhops, but from the matter of their Deciſions, which were received with an Univerſal Conſent, for there were many more Biſhops at the Council of <hi>Arimini,</hi> which was condemned, than either at <hi>Nice</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which were received. Chriſt had named no Head of the whole Church, as God had named no Head of the World; but that grew up for Orders ſake, as there were Arch-biſhops ſet over Provinces; yet ſome Popes were condemned for Hereſy as <hi>Liberius,</hi> and others. If Faith muſt be ſhewed by Works, the ill Lives of moſt Popes of late ſhewed that their Faith was to be ſuſpected; and all the Priviledges which Princes or Synods granted to that See might be recalled. Popes ought to ſubmit themſelves to General Councils, and were be tried by them; he ſhewed what were the preſent Corruptions of the Pope and his Court, which needed Reformation: The Pope according to the Decree of the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> was the Churches Vicar,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170737:86"/>and not Chriſt's; and ſo was accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it. The Churches of <hi>France</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Council to be above the Pope, which had been acknowledged by many Popes themſelves. The Power of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils had alſo Bounds, nor could they judg of the Rights of Princes, or proceed to a Sentence againſt a King; nor were their Canons of any force till Princes added their Sanctions to them. Councils ought alſo to proceed moderately, even againſt thoſe that held Errors, and ought not to impoſe things indifferent too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely. The Scriptures, and not Men's Traditions, ought to be the Standards of their Definitions. The Divines of <hi>Paris</hi> held, That a Council could not make a new Article of Faith that was not in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and all Chriſt's Promiſes to the Church were to be underſtood with this condition, <hi>if they kept the Faith:</hi> therefore there was great reaſon to doubt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Authority of a Council, ſome of them had contradicted others, and many others were never received. The Fathers had always appealed to the Scriptures, as Superiour in Authority to Councils, by which only all Controverſies ought to be decided; yet on the other hand, it was dangerous to be wiſe in ones own Conceit, and he thought when the Fathers all agreed in the Expoſition of any place of Scripture, that ought to be look'd on as flowing from the Spirit of God. He ſhewed how little Regard was to be had
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170737:86"/>to a Council, in which the Pope preſided, and that if any common Error had paſt upon the World, when that came to be diſcovered, every one was at liberty to ſhake it off, even tho they had ſworn to maintain that Error: this he applied to the Pope's Authority.</q> In concluſion, he promiſed to entertain them with another Diſcourſe of the Authority that all Biſhops had in their Sees, and that Princes had within their Dominions. But I could never recover that, and probably it is loſt.</p>
               <p>This was the ſtate of the Court after King <hi>Henry</hi> had ſhaken off the Pope's Power,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The State of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> and aſſumed a Supremacy in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Affairs. The Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were generally well ſatisfied with the Change; but the Body of the People was more under the Power of the Prieſts; and they ſtudied to infuſe in them great Fears of a Change in Religion. It was ſaid the King was now joyning himſelf to Hereticks, that both the Queen, <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> favoured them. It was left free to diſpute what were Articles of Faith, and what were only the Decrees of Popes; and Changes would be made under this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that they only rejected thoſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which were ſupported by the Papal Authority. The Monks and Friars ſaw themſelves left at the King's Mercy. Their Bulls could be no longer uſeful to them. The trade of new Saints, or Indulgences, was near an end; they had alſo ſome Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170737:87"/>that <hi>Cromwell</hi> was forming a Project for ſuppreſſing them; ſo they thought it neceſſary for their own Preſervation to imbroil the King's Affairs, as much as was poſſible; therefore both in Confeſſions and Diſcourſes, they were infuſing into the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a diſlike of the King's Proceedings, and this did ſo far work on them, that if the Emperour's Affairs had been in ſuch a condition, that he could have made War on the King, he might have done it with great Advantage; and found a ſtrong Party in <hi>England</hi> on his ſide. But the Practices of the Clergy at home, and of Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> abroad, the Libels that were publiſhed, and the Rebellions that were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards raiſed in <hi>England,</hi> wrought ſo much on the King's Temper, that was naturally imperious and boiſterous, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came too apt to commit Acts of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Severity, and to bring his Subjects into Trouble upon the ſlighteſt Grounds; and his new Title of Head of the Church, ſeemed to have encreaſed his former Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and made him fancy that all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were bound to regulate their Belief by the meaſures he ſet them. He had now raigned 25 Years, in all which time none had ſuffered for Crimes againſt the State, but <hi>Pool</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Stafford</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> (the former was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in Obedience to his Father's laſt Commands; the latter fell by Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi>'s Malice; he had alſo been inveigled by a Prieſt to imagine he had a Right to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170737:87"/>the Crown) but in the laſt ten Years of his Life, Inſtances of Severity returned more frequently. The Biſhops and Abbots did what they could to free the King of any Jealouſies that might be raiſed in him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; and of their own accord, before any Law was made about it, they ſwore to maintain the King's Supremacy. The firſt Act of it was the making <hi>Cromwell</hi> Vicar General, and Viſitor of all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries and Churches of <hi>England,</hi> with a Delegation of the King's Supremacy to him; he was alſo empowered to give Commiſſions ſubaltern to himſelf; and all Wills, where the Eſtate was in value above 200 <hi>l.</hi> were to be proved in his Court. This was afterwards enlarged, and he was made the King's <hi>Vicegerent</hi> in Eccleſiaſtical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and had the Precedence of all next the Royal Family; and his Authority was in all Points the ſame, that the Legates had in time of Popery: for as the King's came in the Popes room; ſo the <hi>Vicegerent</hi> was what the Legates had been. Pains was taken to engage all the Clergy to declare for the Supreamacy. At <hi>Oxford</hi> a publick Determination was made, to which every Member aſſented, that the Pope had no more Authority in <hi>England,</hi> than any other Forreign Biſhop. The <hi>Franciſcans</hi> at <hi>Richmond</hi> made ſome more Oppoſition; they ſaid, by the Rule of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> they were bound to obey the Holy See. The Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi> told them that all the Biſhops in <hi>England,</hi> all the Heads of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170737:88"/>Houſes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1535"/> and the moſt learned Divines had ſigned that Propoſition. St. <hi>Francis</hi> made his Rule in <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was Metropolitan, but that ought not to extend to <hi>England:</hi> and it was ſhewed that the Chapter cited by them, was not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by him, but added ſince; yet they continued poſitive in their refuſal to ſign it.</p>
               <p>It was well known that all the Monks and Friars,
<note place="margin">A general Viſitation propoſed.</note> tho they complied with the Time, yet they hated this new Power of the King's; the People were alſo ſtartled at it; ſo one Dr. <hi>Leighton,</hi> that had been in the Cardinal's Service with <hi>Cromwell,</hi> propoſed a General Viſitation of all the Religious Houſes in <hi>England:</hi> and thought that nothing would reconcile the Nation ſo much to the King's Supremacy, as to ſee ſome good Effect flow from it. Others thought this was too hardy a Step, and that it would provoke the Religious Orders too much. Yet it was known that they were guilty of ſuch Diſorders, that nothing could ſo effectually keep them in awe as the enquiring into theſe. <hi>Cranmer</hi> led the way to this by a Metropolitical Viſitation, for which he obtained the King's Licence; he took care to ſee that the Pope's Name was ſtruck out of all the Offices of the Church, and that the King's Supremacy was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acknowledged.</p>
               <p>In <hi>October</hi> the General Viſitation of the Monaſteries was begun;
<note place="margin">Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for it.</note> which was caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral Precincts: Inſtructions were
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170737:88"/>given them, directing them what things to enquire after, as whether the Houſes had the full number according to their Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if they performed Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the appointed Hours; what Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they had, what were their Statutes? how their Heads were choſen? and how their Vows were obſerved? Whether they lived according to the Severities of their Orders? how the Maſter and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers did their Duties? how their Lands and their Revenues were managed? what Hoſpitality was kept? and what care was taken of the Novices? what Benefices were in their Gift, and how they diſpoſed of them? how the Incloſures of the Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were kept? whether the Nuns went abroad, or if Men were admitted to come to them? how they imploied their time, and what Prieſts they had for their Confeſſors? They were alſo ordered to give them ſome Injunctions in the King's Name, That they ſhould acknowledge his Supremacy, and maintain the Act of Succeſſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare all to be abſolved from any Rules or Oaths that bound them to obey the Pope; and that all their Statutes tending to that, ſhould be razed out of their Books. That the Abbots ſhould not have choice Diſhes, but plain Tables for Hoſpitality; and that the Scriptures ſhoul be read at Meals; that they ſhould have daily Lectures of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and maintain ſome of every Houſe at the Univerſity. The Abbot was required to inſtruct the Monks in true Religion, and to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170737:89"/>ſhew them that it did not conſiſt in outward Ceremonies, but in Cleanneſs of Heart, and Purity of Life, and the worſhiping of God in Spirit and Truth. Rules were given about their Revenues, and againſt admitting any under 20 Years of Age. The Viſitors were empower'd to puniſh Offenders, or to bring them to anſwer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Viſitor General.</p>
               <p>What the Ancient Brittiſh Monks were is not well known;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The State of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> whether they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned according to the Rules of the Monks of <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> is matter of Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. They were in all things obedient to their Biſhops, as all the Monks of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Times were. But upon the Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the <hi>Gothick</hi> Wars brought upon <hi>Italy, Benedict</hi> ſet up a new Order with more Artificial Rules for its Government. Not long after, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great raiſed the Credit of that Order much, by his Books of Dialogues: and <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk being ſent by him to convert <hi>England,</hi> did found a Monaſtery at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Name, which both the King and <hi>Auſtin</hi> exempted from the Arch-biſhop's Juriſdiction. But there is great reaſon to ſuſpect that moſt of thoſe Antient Charters were forged. After that many other Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies were founded and exempted by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> if Credit is due to the Leiger Books or Chartularies of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. In the end of the eighth Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the <hi>Danes</hi> made Deſcents upon <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and finding the moſt Wealth and the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170737:89"/>leaſt Reſiſtance in the Monaſteries, they generally plundered them, in ſo much that the Monks were forced to quit their Seats, and they left them to the Secular Clergy; ſo that in King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s time there was ſcarce a Monk left in all <hi>England.</hi> He was a leud and cruel Prince; and <hi>Dunſtan</hi> and other Monks taking Advantage from ſome hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Conſcience that he fell under, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him that the reſtoring the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick State, would be matter of great <hi>Merit;</hi> ſo he converted many of the Chapters into Monaſteries: and by the Foundation of the Priory of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> it appears he had then founded 47, and intended to raiſe them to 50, the number of Pardon; tho the Invention of Jubilees being ſo much later, gives occaſion to believe this was alſo a Forgery. He only exempted his Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries from all Payments to the Biſhops; but others were exempted from Epiſcopal Juriſdiction. In ſome only the Precinct was exempted, in others, the Exemption was extended to all the Lands or Churches belonging to them. The lateſt Exemption from Epiſcopal Juriſdiction granted by any King, is that of <hi>Battel</hi> founded by <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour: After this the Exemptions were granted by the Popes, who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to an Univerſal Juriſdiction, aſſumed this among other Uſurpations. Some Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies had alſo the Priviledg of being Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries to all that fled to them. The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all their Wealth, was the belief of Purgatory, and of the Virtue that was
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170737:90"/>in Maſſes to redeem Souls out of it; and that theſe eaſed the Torments of departed Souls, and at laſt delivered them out of them; ſo it paſt among all for a piece of Piety to Parents, and of care for their own Souls and Families, to endow thoſe Houſes with ſome Lands, upon condition that they ſhould have Maſſes ſaid for them, as it was agreed on more or leſs, frequently accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure of the Gift. This was like to have drawn in the whole Wealth of the Nation into thoſe Houſes, if the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Mortmain</hi> had not put ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to that Superſtition. They alſo perſwaded the World, that the Saints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded for them, and would take it kindly at their hands, if they made great Offerings to their Shrines, and would thereupon intercede the more earneſtly for them: The credulous Vulgar meaſuring the Court of Heaven by thoſe on Earth, believed Preſents might be of great Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy there, and thought the new Favourites would have the moſt Weight in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions: So upon every new. Canoniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there was a new Fit of Devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the laſt Saint, which made the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to grow almoſt out of requeſt. Some Images were believed to have an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Virtue in them, and Pilgrimages to theſe were much extolled. There was alſo great Rivalry among the ſeveral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and different Houſes of the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, every one magnifying their own Saints, their Images and Relicks moſt.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170737:90"/>The Wealth of theſe Houſes brought them under great Corruptions. They were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally very diſſolute, and groſly ignorant. Their Priviledges were become a publick Grievance, and their Lives gave great Scandal to the World; So that, as they had found it eaſy to bear down the Secular Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, when their own Vices were more ſecret; the begging Friers found it as eaſy to carry the Eſteem of the World from them. Theſe under the Appearance of Poverty, and courſe Diet, and Cloathing, gained much Eſteem, and became almoſt the only Preachers and Confeſſors then in the World. They had a General at <hi>Rome,</hi> from whom they received ſuch Directions, as the Popes ſent them; ſo that they were more uſeful to the Papacy then the Monks had been. They had alſo the School-Learning in their hands, ſo that they were generally much cheriſhed. But they living much in the World, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their Vices ſo artificially as the Monks had done; and tho ſeveral Reformations had been made of their Orders, yet they had all fallen under great Scandal, and a general Diſeſteem. The King intended to erect new Biſhopricks; and in order to that, it was neceſſary to make uſe of ſome of their Revenues. He alſo apprehended a War from the Emperour, and for that end, he intended to fortify his Harbours, and to encourage Shipping, and Trade, upon which, the Ballance of the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan then to turn: And in order to that, he
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170737:91"/>reſolved to make uſe of the Wealth of thoſe Houſes, and thought, the beſt way to bring that into his hands, would be to expoſe their Vices, that ſo they might quite loſe the Eſteem they might yet be in with ſome, and ſo it might be leſs dangerous to ſuppreſs them. <hi>Cranmer</hi> promoted this much, both becauſe theſe Houſes were founded on groſs Abuſes, and ſubſiſted by them; and theſe were neceſſary to be removed, if a Reformation went on. The Extent of many Dioceſſes was alſo ſuch, that one man could not overſee them; ſo he intended to have more Biſhopricks founded, and to have Houſes at every Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral for the Education of thoſe who ſhould be imploied in the Paſtoral Charge. The Viſitors went over <hi>England,</hi> and found in many places, monſtrous Diſorders. The Sin of <hi>Sodom</hi> was found in many Houſes; great Factions, and Barbarous Cruelties, were in others; and in ſome, they found Tools for Coining. The Report contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many abominable things, that are not fit to be mentioned: Some of theſe were printed, but the greateſt part is loſt; only a Report of 144 Houſes is yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</p>
               <p>The firſt Houſe that was ſurrendered to the King,
<note place="margin">Some Houſes ſurrend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered.</note> was <hi>Langden,</hi> in <hi>Kent;</hi> the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot was found a Bed with a Whore, who went in the Habit of a Lay Brother: This perhaps made him more willing to give an Example to the reſt; ſo he and ten of his Monks, ſigned a Reſignation of their Houſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170737:91"/>to the King. Two other Houſes in the ſame County, <hi>Folkeſton,</hi> and <hi>Dover,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their Example. And in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Year, four other Houſes made the like Surrenders: and theſe were all that I find before the Act of Parliament paſt, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the leſſer Monaſteries.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Katherine</hi> was put to much trouble,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1536"/> for keeping the Title, Queen,
<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Queen</hi> Katherin's <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </note> but bore it reſolutely, and ſaid, That ſince the Pope had judged that her Marriage was good, ſhe would die rather than do any thing in prejudice of it. Her Sufferings begot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in the People; and all the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Clergy ſupported her Intereſts zealouſly. But now her Troubles ended with her Life. She deſired to be buried among the Obſervant Friers, for they had ſuffered moſt for her. She ordered 500 Maſſes to be ſaid for her Soul; and that one of her Women ſhould go a Pilgrimage to our Lady of <hi>Walſingham,</hi> and give 200 Nobles on her way to the Poor. When ſhe found Death coming on her, as ſhe writ to the Emperour, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Daughter to his care: So ſhe writ to the King, with this Inſcription, <hi>My dear Lord, King, and Husband.</hi> She forgave him all the Injuries he had done her; and wiſh'd him to have regard to his Soul. She recommended her Daughter to his Care, and deſired him to be kind to her three Maids, and to pay her Servants a Years Wages; and ended thus, <hi>mine Eyes deſire you above all things.</hi> She died on the Eighth
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170737:92"/>of <hi>January,</hi> at <hi>Kimbolt on,</hi> in the 50th Year of her Age, 33 years after ſhe came to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> She ſhas a Devout and Exemplary Woman: She uſed to work with her own hands, and kept her Women at work with her. The Severities and Devotions that were known to her Prieſts, and her Alms-Deeds, joined to the Troubles ſhe fell in, begat a high Eſteem of her in all ſorts of People. The King complained often of her Peeviſhneſs; but that was perhaps, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, as much to the Provocations he gave her, as to the Sowrneſs of her Temper. He ordered her to be buried in the Abbey of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and was ſomewhat touched with her Death. But Q. <hi>Ann</hi> did not carry this ſo decently as became a happy Rival.</p>
               <p>In <hi>February</hi> a Parliament met,
<note place="margin">In Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the leſſer Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries ſuppreſſed,</note> after a Prorogation of 14 Months. The Act im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering 32 to reviſe the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, was confirmed; but no time was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited for finiſhing it, ſo it had no effect. The chief buſineſs of this Seſſion, was the ſuppreſſing of the Monaſteries, under 200 <hi>l.</hi> a Year. The Report the Viſitors made was read in the two Houſes, and diſpoſed them to great eaſineſs in this matter. The Act ſets forth the great diſorders of thoſe Houſes, and the many unſucceſsful Attempts that had been made to reform them; ſo the Religious that were in them, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be put in the greater Houſes, where Religion was better obſerved, and the Revenues of them were given to the King. Thoſe Houſes were much richer
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170737:92"/>than they ſeemed to be; for an abuſe that had run over <hi>Europe,</hi> of keeping the Rents of the Church at their firſt Rates; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of raiſing them, the exacting great Fines for the Incumbent, when the Leaſes were renewed, was ſo groſs in thoſe Houſes, that ſome rated but at 200 <hi>l.</hi> were in real value worth many Thouſands. By another Act, a new Court was erected, with the Title of <hi>the Court of the Augmentations of the King's Revenue,</hi> conſiſting of a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, a Treaſurer, 10 Auditors, 17 Receivers, beſides ofther Officers. The King was alſo empowered to make new Foundations, of ſuch of thoſe Houſes now ſuppreſſed, as he pleaſed, which were in all 370, and ſo this Parliament, after ſix Years Continuance, was now diſſolved.</p>
               <p>A Convocation ſate at this time,
<note place="margin">A Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the Bille deſigned.</note> in which, a motion was made for Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Bible into Engliſh, which had been promiſed when <hi>Tindal</hi>'s Tranſlation was condemned, but was afterwards laid aſide by the Clergy, as neither neceſſary nor expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient: So it was ſaid, that thoſe, whoſe Office it was to teach People the Word of God, did all they could to ſuppreſs it. <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, and the Apoſtles, wrote in the Vulgar Tongue: Chriſt directed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſearch the Scriptures; and as ſoon as any Nation was converted to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, the Bible was tranſlated into their Language; nor was it ever taken out of the hands of the People, till the Chriſtian Religion was ſo corrupted, that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170737:93"/>it was not ſafe to truſt them with ſuch a <hi>Book,</hi> which would have ſo manifeſtly diſcovered thoſe Errours; and the Legends, as agreeing better with thoſe Abuſes, were read inſtead of the Word of God. So <hi>Cranmer</hi> look'd on the putting the Bible in the People's hands, as the moſt effectual means for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Reformation; and therefore mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the King might be prayed to give order for it. But <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and all the other Party, oppoſed this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently. They ſaid, All the extravagant Opinions then in <hi>Germanny,</hi> roſe from the indiſcreet uſe of the Scriptures. Some of thoſe Opinions were at this time diſſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>England,</hi> both againſt the Divinity, and Incarnation of Chriſt, and the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sacraments, for which 19 <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> had been burnt in <hi>England</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Year. It was therefore ſaid, That during theſe Diſtractions, the uſe of the Scriptures would prove a great Snare: So it was propoſed, that inſtead of them, their might be ſome ſhort Expoſition of the Chriſtian Religion put in the Peoples hands, which might keep them in a certain Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the King and the Church: But it was carried in the Convocation for the Affirmative. At Court, Men were much divided in this Point; ſome ſaid, if the King gave way to it, he would never be able after that to govern his People, and that they would break into many Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But on the other hand, it was ſaid, That nothing would make the Difference
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170737:93"/>between the Pope's Power, and the King's Supremacy, appear more eminently, than if the one gave the People the free uſe of the Word of God; whereas the other had kept them in Darkneſs, and ruled them by a blind Obedience. It would be alſo a great mean to extinguiſh the Intereſt that either the Pope or the Monks had in <hi>England,</hi> to put the Bible in the People's hands, in which it would appear, that the World had been long deceived by their Impoſtures, which had no Foundation in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Theſe Reaſons joyned with the Intereſt that the Queen had in the King, prevailed ſo far with him, that he gave order for ſetting about this with all poſſible haſt; and within three Years the Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it was finiſhed. At this time, the King was in ſome Treaty with the <hi>German</hi> Princes, not only for a League in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Concerns, but likewiſe in matters of Religion. The King thought the <hi>Germans</hi> ſhould have in all things ſubmitted to him; and the Opinion he had of his own Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was perhaps heightned a little with his new Title of <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> made him expect, that they ſhould in all points comply with him. <hi>Gardiner</hi> was then his Ambaſſadour in <hi>France,</hi> and diſwaded him much from any Religious League with them, as that which would alienate the World abroad, and his People at home from him.</p>
               <p>The Popiſh Party ſaw the intereſt the Queen had in him,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Ann's <hi>Fall.</hi>
                  </note> was the great Obſtacle
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170737:94"/>of their Deſignes: She grew not only in the Kings Eſteem, but in the Love of the Nation. The laſt Nine Months of her Life, She gave above 14000 <hi>l.</hi> in Alms to the Poor, and was much ſet on doing good. Soon after Queen <hi>Katherin</hi>'s Death, ſhe bore a dead Son, which was believed to have made ſome Impreſſion on the King's mind. It was alſo conſidered, that now Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> being dead, the King might marry another, and be ſet right again with the Pope and the Emperour: And the Iſſue by any other Marriage would never be queſtioned; whereas, while Queen <hi>Ann</hi> lived, the ground of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy ſtill remained, and her Iſſue would be Illegitimated, her Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing null from the beginning, as they thought. With theſe Reaſons of State, the King's Affectiosn joyned, for he was now in Love with <hi>Jane Seymour,</hi> whoſe humour was tempered in a mean, between the Gravity of Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> and the Pleaſantneſs of Queen <hi>Ann.</hi> The poor Queen uſed all poſſible Arts to reinflame a dying Affection; but the King was changed, and inſtead of being wrought on by her Careſſes, he came to look on them as Artifices to cover ſome other Criminal Affection. Her cheerfulneſs was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes governed with Decency and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: And her Brother's Wife being jealous of her Husband and Her, poſſeſſed the King with her own Apprehenſions, and filled his Head with many Stories.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170737:94"/>
                  <hi>Norris, Weſton,</hi> and <hi>Brereton</hi> the King's Servants, and <hi>Smeton</hi> a Muſician, were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be particularly officious about her. Somewhat was pretended to have been ſworn by the Lady <hi>Wyngfield</hi> at her Death, that determined the King; but there is little light left to judg of that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The King was at Juſts at <hi>Greenwich,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>May</hi> 1,</note> where it was reported, that he was diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Queen, for letting her Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief fall to one for wiping his Face; but this ſeems to be a Fiction; for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſummoned the day before that, and then it was reſolved to deſtroy her. The King left her, upon which ſhe was confined to her Chamber, and the five before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned were ſeized on, and ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the next day ſhe was carried thither. On the River, ſome Privy Counſellors came to examine her; but ſhe made deep Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her Innocence; and as ſhe landed at the <hi>Tower,</hi> ſhe fell down on her Knees, and prayed God ſo to aſiſt her, as ſhe was free of the Crimes laid to her charge: After this ſhe fell into fits of the Mother, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe laughed, and at other times ſhe wept exceſſively: She was alſo devout and light by turns; and ſometimes ſhe ſtood upon her Vindication, and at other times ſhe confeſſed ſome Indiſcretions, which ſhe afterwards denied. All the People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her made the moſt of every Word that fell from her, and ſent it immediately to Court. The others that were impriſoned on her account, denied every thing, only
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170737:95"/>
                  <hi>Smeton</hi> confeſſed Leudneſs with her. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and others that came to examine her, made her believe that both <hi>Norris</hi> and <hi>Smeton</hi> had accuſed her; but tho that was falſe, yet it had this Effect on her, that it made her confeſs that which did totally alienate the King from her. She acknowledged that ſhe had rallied <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> that he waited for the King's Death, and then thought to have her, which tho he denied, yet upon that ſhe fell out with him. She denied that <hi>Smeton</hi> was ever in her Chamber, but once when he came to play on the Virginals. She inſinuated as if he had made Love to her; for ſeeing him one day penſive, ſhe told him he muſt not expect that ſhe ſhould talk to him, ſince he was ſo mean a Perſon, and he anſwered, A Look would ſerve him. She alſo ſaid, <hi>Weſton</hi> had ſeemed jealous of <hi>Norris,</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oft in her Chamber, and had declared Love to her, upon which <hi>ſhe defied him.</hi> Whether theſe Confeſſions were real Truths, or the Effects of Imagination and Vapors, cannot be certainly determined at this diſtance. It is probable there had been ſome Levities in her Carriage that were not becoming.</p>
               <p>All the Court was now turned againſt her, and ſhe had no Friend about the King but <hi>Cranmer;</hi> and therefore her Enemies procured an Order for him not to come to Court; yet he put all to hazard, and wrote the King a long Letter upon this Critical Juncture; <q rend="inline">He acknowledged that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170737:95"/>if the Things reported of the Queen were true, it was the greateſt Affliction that ever befel the King, and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him to bear it with Patience and Submiſſion to the Will of God: he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he never had a better Opinion of any Woman than of her; and that next the King, he was more bound to her, than to all Perſons living; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he begged the King's leave to pray that ſhe might be found Innocent; he loved her not a little, becauſe of the Love which ſhe ſeemed to bear to God, and his Goſpel; but if ſhe was guilty, all that loved the Goſpel muſt hate her, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given the greateſt Slander poſſible to the Goſpel: but he prayed the King not to entertain any Prejudice to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel on her account, nor give the World rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay, That his Love to it was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Power that ſhe had with him.</q> The King's Jealouſy was now too deeply rooted to admit of any Cure, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream one:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>May</hi> 12.</note> The Indictments were laid in the Counties of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> the former relating to what was done in <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich. Smeton</hi> pleaded <hi>Guilty,</hi> and confeſſed he had known the Queen catnally three times; the reſt pleaded <hi>not guilty;</hi> but they were all condemned.</p>
               <p>Three days after that,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>May</hi> 15. Her Trial.</note> the Queen and her Brother (who was then a Peer) were tried before the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> as High Steward and a Court of 27 Peers. It has been oft given out to defame her the more,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170737:96"/>that her own Father ſate and condemned her: but the Record of the Attainder ſhews that is falſe, for he was not of the Number. The Crime charged on her was, That ſhe had procured her Brother and four others to lie with her; and had often ſaid to them, <hi>That the King never had her Heart;</hi> and this was to the Slander of the Iſſue begotten between the King and her, which was Treaſon by the Act that confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her Marriage: ſo that Act that was made for the Marriage, was now turned on her to ruine her. They would not now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg her the King's lawful Wife, and therefore they did not found the Treaſon on the known Statute 25th <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. It does not appear what Evidence was brought againſt her: for <hi>Smeton</hi> being already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, could not be made uſe of; and his never being brought face to face againſt her, gave great ſuſpition that he was perſwaded to confeſs by baſe Practices. The Evidence, as appears by <hi>Spelman</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, that was then a Judg, was only the Declaration of a dead Woman: but whether that was forged or real, can never be known till the great Day diſcovers it. The Judgment in caſe of Treaſon for a Woman, is Burning; but it was given either for that, or beheading at the King's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The Judges complained of this as contrary to Law, but there was a ſecret Reaſon for it, into which they did not penetrate. The Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was one of the Judges, he had been once in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170737:96"/>love with the Queen, and either ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of that, or ſome other Accident made that he fell ſuddenly ſo ill, that he could not ſtay out the Trial; for after the Queen was judged, he went out of the Gourt before her Brother was tried, who was condemned upon the ſame Evidence. Yet all this did not ſatisfy the enraged King; he reſolved to illegitimate his Daughter, and in order to that to annul his Marriage with the Queen. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> had ſaid to Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> that he had engaged himſelf ſo far with her, that he could not go back, which was perhaps done by ſome Promiſe conceived in Words of the <hi>Future Tenſe;</hi> but no Promiſe, unleſs in the Words of the <hi>Preſent Tenſe,</hi> could annul the Subſequent Marriage. Perhaps the Queen did not underſtand that Difference, or probably the fear of ſo terrible a Death as <hi>Burning,</hi> wrought ſo much on her, that ſhe confeſſed a Contract; but the Earl de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it poſitively, and took the Sacrament upon it, wiſhing that it might turn to his Damnation, if there was ever either Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or Promiſe of Marriage between them. She was ſecretly carried to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and confeſſed a Precontract, upon which her Marriage with the King was judged null from the beginning; yet this was ſo little known at that time, that <hi>Spelman</hi> writes of it as a thing only talked of, but it was publiſhed in the next Parliament. Theſe two Sentences contradicted one
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170737:97"/>another; for if ſhe was never the King's Wife, ſhe could not be guilty of Adultery, for there could be no breach of the Faith of Wedlock, if they were never truly marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the King was reſolved both to be rid of her, and to declare his Daughter by her a <hi>Baſtard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When ſhe had Intimations given her to prepare for Death;
<note place="margin">Her Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> among other things ſhe reflected on her Carriage to Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> to whom ſhe had been too ſevere a <hi>Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother:</hi> So ſhe made one of her Women ſit down, and ſhe fell on her Knees before her and charged her to go to Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and in that Poſture, and in her Name, to ask her Forgiveneſs for all ſhe had done againſt her. This Tenderneſs of Conſcience ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give much Credit to the continual Proteſtations of her Innocence, which ſhe made to the laſt. The day before her Death, ſhe ſent her laſt Meſſage to the King, aſſerting her Innocence, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending her Daughter to his Care, and thanking him for his advancing her, firſt to be a Marchioneſs, then to be a Queen, and now, when he could raiſe her no higher on Earth, for ſending her to be a Saint in Heaven. The day ſhe died the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> writ to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> that it was not fit to publiſh the time of her Execution, for the fewer that were preſent it would be the better; ſince he believed ſhe would declare her Innocence at the hour of her Death; for that morning ſhe had made great Proteſtations of it, when ſhe received
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170737:97"/>the Sacrament, and ſeemed to long for Death, and had great Joy and Pleaſure in it; ſhe was glad to hear the Executioner was good, for ſhe ſaid ſhe had a very ſhort Neck, at which ſhe laughed heartily. A little before Noon, ſhe was brought to the place of Execution; there were preſent ſome of the Chief Officers and Great Men of the Court; ſhe was, it ſeems prevailed on out of regard to her Daughter, to make no Reflections on the hard meaſure ſhe met with, nor to ſay any thing, touching the Grounds, on which Sentence paſt againſt her, only ſhe deſired that all would judg the beſt: ſhe commended the King highly, and ſo took her leave of the World: She was for ſome time in her private Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and concluded, <hi>To Chriſt I commend my Soul;</hi> upon which the Executioner, who was brought from <hi>Calis</hi> on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, cut off her Head, and ſo little regard was had to her Body, that it was put in a Cheſt of <hi>Elm-tree,</hi> made to ſend Arrows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was buried in the Chappel in the <hi>Tower. Norris</hi> was much dealt with to accuſe her, and his Life was promiſed him if he would do it; but he ſaid he knew ſhe was Innocent, and would die a thouſand times rather than defame her: ſo he and the other three were beheaded, and all of them continued to the laſt to vindicate her. <hi>Smeton</hi> was hanged, and it was ſaid, that he retracted all before he died; but of that, there is no certainty.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:170737:98"/>
               <p>When this was done, it was very vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly cenſured. The Popiſh Party obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ſhe who had ſupplanted Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cenſures paſt upon it.</note> did now meet with harder mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; her faint way of ſpeaking concerning her Innocence at laſt, was judged too high a Complement to the King in a dying Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſhewed more regard to her Daughter than to her own Honour; yet ſhe writ a Letter to the King in ſo high a ſtrain both of Wit and Natural Eloquence in her own Juſtification, that it may be reckoned one of the beſt compoſed pieces of that time. In her Carriage it ſeems there were ſome Freedoms that became not her Quality, and had encouraged thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Perſons to make ſome Addreſſes to her, which is never done when there is ſuch difference of Conditions, without ſome Encouragement is firſt given. It was ſaid on the other hand, that the King of all Men, had the leaſt reaſon to ſuſpect her, ſince after ſix Years Courtſhip, he gained nothing from her, before he married her; but the Particulars ſhe confeſſed, gave much matter for Jealouſy, eſpecially in ſo violent a Man, to work upon; and ſo it was no wonder if it tranſported him out of meaſure. Others condemned <hi>Cranmer</hi> as too obſequious for paſſing the Sentence annulling the Marriage: yet when ſhe came and confeſſed a Precontract in Court, he could not avoid the giving Sentence upon it. All that hated the Reformation infulted, and ſaid, it now appeared how
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170737:98"/>bad that Cauſe was, which was ſupported by ſuch a Patron. But it was anſwered, that her Faults could not reflect on thoſe, who being ignorant of them, had deſired her Protection. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great had courted and magnified <hi>Phocas</hi> and <hi>Bruni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child,</hi> after he knew their Villanies; and <hi>Irene</hi> after her barbarous Cruelties, was rot a little extolled for her Zeal in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Images. It has ſeemed ſtrange to ſome, that during her Daughter's long and glorious Reign, none writ in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Mother, which officious Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers are apt to do often without any good Grounds, ſo that Silence was made an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of her Guilt, and that ſhe could not be defended. But perhaps that was an effect of the Wiſdom of the Miniſters of that time, who would not ſuffer ſo nice a Point, upon which the Queen's Legitimation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, to be brought into diſpute. The day after <hi>Anne Boleyn</hi>'s Death, the King married <hi>Jane Scimour,</hi> who gained more upon him, than all his Wives ever did: But ſhe was happy that ſhe did not out-live his Love to her.</p>
               <p>Lady <hi>Mary</hi> was adviſed upon this turn of Affairs,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lady</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<hi>'s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion oo the King.</hi>

               <p>On the 8th of <hi>June</hi> the Parliament met,
<note place="margin">A Farlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meets.</note> which ſhews that it was ſummoned before the Juſts at <hi>Greenwich.</hi> The Chancellour told them, that the King had called them to ſettle the Succeſſion of the Crown, in caſe he ſhould dye without Children law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten, and to repeal the Act made concerning his Marriage with Queen <hi>Anne.</hi> It ſeems the Parliament was not at firſt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170737:99"/>eaſily brought to comply with theſe things; and that it was neceſſary to take ſome pains to prepare them to it. For the Bill of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, was not put in till the 30th of <hi>June,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">but then it was quickly diſpatched with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Oppoſition: by it the Attainder of Queen <hi>Anne</hi> and her Complices is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; both the Sentences of Divorces paſs'd upon the King's two former Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages were alſo confirmed; and the Iſſue by both was illegitimated and for ever excluded from claiming the Crown by Lineal Deſcent: And the Succeſſion was eſtabliſhed on the King's Iſſue by his preſent Queen, or any whom he might afterwards marry. But it not being fit to declare who ſhould ſucceed in default of that, leſt the Perſon ſo named might be thereby enabled to raiſe Commotions, in Confidence of the King's Wiſdom, and Affection to his People, they left it to him nominate his Succeſſors, either by Letters Patents, or by his laſt Will ſigned by his Hand, and promiſed to obey the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo nominated by him. It was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Treaſon</hi> to maintain the Lawfulneſs of his former Marriages, or of his Iſſue by them, and it was made not only Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but a forfeiture of the Right of Succeſſion, if any of thoſe whom the King ſhould name in default of others, ſhould endeavour to get before them.</q> The <hi>Scots</hi> complained of this Act, and ſaid, their Queen <hi>Dowager,</hi> being King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Eldeſt Siſter, could not be put by her Right, after
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170737:100"/>the King's lawful Iſſue. But by this the King was now made <hi>Maſter</hi> indeed, and had the Crown put entirely in his Hands, to be diſpoſed of at his Pleaſure; and his Daughters were now to depend wholly on him. He had it alſo in his Power in a great meaſure to pacify the Emperour by providing, that his Kinſwoman might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Crown.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 7th,

                     <hi>Pope</hi> Paul <hi>the</hi> 3d, <hi>propoſes a Recoacili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with the King.</hi>
                  </note> was now dead, and <hi>Farneſe</hi> ſucceeded by the Name of <hi>Paul</hi> the 3d, who, after an unſuccesful At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which he made for reconciling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the King, when that was rejected, and <hi>Fiſher</hi> was beheaded, thundered out a moſt terrible Sentence of Depoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: Yet now, ſince both Queen <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi> and Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> upon whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Breach was made, were out of the way, he thought it a fit time to try what might be done; and ordered <hi>Caſſali</hi> to let the King know that he had always favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Cauſe when he was a Cardinal, that he was driven very much againſt his Mind to paſs Sentence againſt him; and that now it would be eaſy for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Favour of the Apoſtolick See.</p>
               <p>But the King inſtead of hearkening to the Propoſition,
<note place="margin">Acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope's Power.</note> got two Acts to be paſs'd; <q rend="inline">The one was for the utter extinguiſhing the Pope's Authority; and it was made a <hi>Premunire</hi> for any to acknowledg it, or to perſwade others to it: And a ſtrict Charge was given to all Magiſtrates under
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170737:100"/>ſevere Penalties to enquire after all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders. By another all Bulls and all Priviledges flowing from them, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared null and void, only Marriages or Conſecrations made by virtue of them, were excepted. All who enjoyed Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges by theſe Bulls were required to bring them into the <hi>Chancery;</hi> upon which the Arch-biſhop was to make them a new Grant of them, and that, being confirmed under the Great Seal, was to be of full force in Law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another Act paſs'd explaining an Exception, that was in the Act for the Reſidence of all Incumbents, by which thoſe who were at the Univerſities were diſpenſed with, upon which many went and lived idlely there. It was therefore now declared that none above the Age of fourty, except Heads and publick Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſhould have the Benefit of that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo,</hi> and that none under that Age ſhould be comprehended in it, except they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their Exerciſes. Another Act paſs'd in Favour of the King's Heirs, if they ſhould Reign before they were of full Age, that they might any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were 24, repeal by Letters Patents all Acts made during their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority. All theſe things being concluded, the Parliament after it had ſate ſix Weeks, was diſſolved.
<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation examines ſome points of Religion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Convocation ſate at the ſame time, and was much imployed: for the Houſe of Lords was oft adjourned, becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170737:101"/>Lords were buſy in the Convocation. <hi>Latimer</hi> preached the Latine Sermon; he was the moſt celebrated Preacher of that time; the Simplicity of his matter, and his Zeal in expreſſing it, being preferred to more elaborate Compoſures. They firſt confirmed the Sentence of the Divorce of the King's Marriage with Queen <hi>Anne.</hi> Then the lower Houſe made an Addreſs to the upper Houſe, complaining of 67 Opinions that they found were much ſpread in the Kingdom: they were either the Tenets of the old Lollards, or the new Reformers, or of the Anabaptiſts; and many of them were only unſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and indiſcreet Expreſſions, which might have flowed from the Heat and Folly of ſome raſh Zealots, who by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant Jeers, and an Affectation of Wit, had endeavoured to diſgrace both the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Doctrines and Rites. They alſo complained of ſome Biſhops who were wanting in their Duty to ſuppreſs ſuch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes; which was underſtood as a Reflection on <hi>Cranmer, Shaxton,</hi> and <hi>Latimer.</hi> It was hoped that <hi>Cranmer</hi> was now declining by Queen <hi>Ann</hi>'s Fall; and the other two who were raiſed by her, would not have ſtood long, if he had been once diſgraced; yet they premiſed to this a Proteſtation, that they intended to do nothing that might diſpleaſe the King, whom they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be <hi>their Supream Head;</hi> and they were reſolved to obey his Laws, and they renounced the Pope's Authority with all
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170737:101"/>his Laws. All theſe Projects failed, for <hi>Cranmer</hi> was now fully eſtabliſhed in the King's Favour; &amp; <hi>Cromwell</hi> was ſent to them with a Meſſage from the King, That they ſhould reform the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, according to the Rules ſet down in Scripture, which ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to all Gloſſes or Decrees of Popes. There was one <hi>Aleſſe</hi> a <hi>Scotch-man,</hi> whom <hi>Cromwell</hi> entertained in his Houſe, and he being appointed to deliver his Opinion, largely ſhewed that there was no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inſtituted by Chriſt, but Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper: <hi>Stokeſly</hi> anſwered him in a long Diſcourſe upon the Principles of the School-Divinity; upon which <hi>Cranmer</hi> took occaſion to ſhew the Vanity of that ſort of Learning, and the Uncertainty of Tradition: and that Religion had been ſo corrupted in the latter Ages, that there was no finding out the Truth, but by reſting in the Authority of the Scriptures. <hi>Fox</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hereford</hi> ſeconded him, and told them the World was now awake, and would be no longer impoſed on by the Niceties and dark Terms of the Schools; for the Laity now did not only read the Scriptures in the vulgar Tongues, but ſearched the Originals themſelves; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt not think to govern them as they had been in the Times of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: Among the Biſhops, <hi>Cranmer, Goodrick, Shaxton, Latimer, Fox, Hilſey,</hi> and <hi>Barlow,</hi> preſt a Reformation; but <hi>Lee</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>York, Stokeſly, Tonſtall,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170737:102"/>Gardiner, Longland,</hi> and ſeveral others oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it as much: But the Conteſt had been ſharper, if the King had not ſent ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles to them to be conſidered of by them; ſo they whoſe chief Deſign it was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend themſelves to Preferment, by the eaſineſs of their Compliance with him in all Points, did agree on the following Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">Articles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on agreed on.</note> That the Biſhops and Preachers ought to inſtruct the People according to the Scripture, the three Creeds, and the four firſt General Councils.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Baptiſm was neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that Children ought to be baptized for the pardon of Original Sin, and obtaining the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Penance was neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and that it conſiſted in Confeſſion, Contrition, and Amendment of Life, with the External Works of Charity, to which a lively Faith ought to be joyned; and that Confeſſion to a Prieſt was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary where it might be had.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> under the forms of Bread and Wine, the very Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, was received.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="5">
                  <q>5. That Juſtification was the Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins, and a perfect Renovation in Chriſt, and that not only outward good Works, but inward Holineſs was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary: As for the outward Ceremonies the People were to be taught, that it was meet to have Images in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but they ought to avoid all ſuch
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170737:102"/>Superſtition as had been uſual in time paſt, and not to worſhip the Image, but only God. 2. That they were to honour the Saints, but not to expect thoſe things from them which God only gives. 3. That they might pray to them for their Interceſſion; but all Superſtitious Abuſes were to ceaſe; and if the King ſhould leſſen the number of Saints Days, they ought to obey him. 4. That the uſe of the Ceremonies was good, and that they contained many My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Significations that tended to raiſe the mind towards God, ſuch were Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Divine Worſhip, Holy Water, Holy Bread, the carrying of Candles, and Palms and Aſhes, and creeping to the Croſs, and the Hallowing the Font, with other Exorciſms. 5. That it was good to pray for departed Souls, and to have Maſſes and Exequies ſaid for them; but the Scriptures having neither declared in what Place they were, nor what Torments they ſuffered, that was uncertain, and to be left to God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Abuſes of the Pope's Pardons, or ſaying Maſſes in ſuch or ſuch Places, or before ſuch Images were to be put away.</q> Theſe Articles were ſigned by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the two Arch-biſhops, ſixteen Biſhops, fourty Abbots, and Priors, and fifty of the lower Houſe; to them the King added a Preface, declaring the Pains that he and the Clergy had been at, for the removing the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Religion that were in the Nation, and that he approved of theſe Articles, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170737:103"/>required all his Subjects to accept them with the like Unanimity with which they were conſented to; and he would be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by encouraged to take further Pains in the like Matters for the future.</p>
               <p>When theſe things were publiſhed,
<note place="margin">They are variouſly cenſured.</note> thoſe that deſired a Reformation, tho they did not approve of every Particular, yet were well pleaſed to ſee things brought under Examination; and ſince ſome things were at this time changed, they did not doubt but more Changes would follow; they were glad that the Scriptures and the Ancient Creeds were made the Standards of the Faith, without adding Tradition, and that the nature of Juſtification and the Goſpel-Covenant were rightly ſtated; that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Worſhip of Images and Saints was condemned, and that Purgatory was left uncertain; but the neceſſity of Auricular Confeſſion, and the Corporal Preſence, the doing Reverence to Images, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saints, were of hard Digeſtion to them: yet they were glad to ſee ſome groſſer Abuſes removed, and a Reformation once ſet on foot. The Popiſh Party were ſorry to ſee four Sacraments paſt over in ſilence; and the Trade about Purgatory put down; and were very apprehenſive of the Precedent of bringing matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion under debate, which would bring on other Alterations. When theſe things were known beyond Sea, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> made great uſe of them, to let all Princes ſee the neceſſity of adhering to the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170737:103"/>Holy See; for no ſooner did <hi>England</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from that, than it began to change the Doctrine likewiſe. The <hi>Germans</hi> on the other hand, ſaid, This was a Political Daubing, for ſatisfying all Parties; and that it ſavoured not of the Sincerity that became the Profeſſors of True Religion, to allow of ſo many Errours. To this it was anſwered, That our Saviour did not deliver all things to his Diſciples, till they were able to bear them. And the Apoſtles did not aboliſh all the Rites of Judaiſm at once, but by a gentle Progreſs intended to wean thoſe that were converted to the Chriſtian Religion from them. The Clergy were to be drawn by ſlow and eaſy Steps out of their Ignorance and Superſtition; whereas the driving on things with precipitated haſt, might ſpoil the whole Deſign, and alienate thoſe who by ſlower Methods might be gained; and it might alſo much endanger the Peace of the Nation.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time other things were in Conſultation, tho not finiſhed.

                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:170737:105"/>miſapplied their Revenues, and did not reſide on their Benefices; he alſo deſired that the other four Sacraments might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into: but theſe things were not at this time taken under any further conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. It is true, Confirmation ſeems to have been examined: The Method in which they made their Enquiries, was this; the Point to be examined was brought under ſo many Heads, in the form of Queries; and to theſe every one gave his Anſwer with his Reaſons: ſo I find two Papers, the one of <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s, the other of <hi>Stokeſly</hi>'s, on this Head; the former runs wholly upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Authority, and he thinks it was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt, but was done by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, by that extraordinary Effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt, that reſted on them: The other founds his Opinion for its being a Sacrament, on the Tradition of the Church; but nothing was determined in this point. <hi>Cranmer</hi> did at this time, offer another Paper to the King, exhorting him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a further Reformation, and that nothing ſhould be determined without clear Proofs from Scripture; for the departing from that Rule, had been the Occaſion of all the Errours that had been in the Church. Many things were now acknowledged to be Errours, for which, ſome not long before, had ſuffered Death. He therefore propoſed ſeveral points to be diſcuſſed; as whether there was a Purgatory? Whether depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saints ought to be invocated, or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be believed? Whether Images ought
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170737:105"/>to be conſidered only as Repreſentations of Hiſtory? And whether it was lawful for the Clergy to marry? He prayed the King not to give Judgment in theſe points, till he heard them well examined: And for the laſt he offered, that if thoſe who would defend the lawfulneſs of it, ſhould not in the Opinion of indifferent Judges, prove their Opinion to be true, they ſhould be willing to ſuffer Death; but if they proved it, all that they deſired was, that the King would leave them to the Liberty which God had allowed them in that matter: But all this was carried no further at this time.</p>
               <p>The Pope had iſſued out a Summons for a General Council at <hi>Mantua,</hi> and had cited the King to it: From this, the King did appeal to a General Council, rightly conſtituted. So a motion being made by <hi>Fox,</hi> that the Convocation ſhould deliver their Senſe in this Particular; They drew up a Paper, in which they ſet forth the great Good that might follow in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council rightly called; but that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more miſchievous, than one called on private malice, according to what <hi>Nazianzen</hi> obſerved of the Councils in his time; And they thought neither the Pope, nor any one Prince, had ſufficient Authority to call one; but that all Princes who had an entire and ſupream Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over all their Subjects, ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to it. This was ſigned by them all, on the 20th of <hi>July;</hi> and ſo was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation diſmiſſ'd. Two days before it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170737:106"/>brake up, <hi>Cromwel</hi> was made the King's Vicegerent in Eccleſiaſtical Matters, of which, ſome Account was formerly given.</p>
               <p>Soon after this,
<note place="margin">The King proteſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Council called by the Pope.</note> the King publiſhed a long and ſharp Proteſtation, againſt the Council ſummoned by the Pope; he denied that he had any Authority to ſummon any of his Subjects: He ſhewed that the place was neither proper nor ſafe; and that no good could be expected from any Council in which the Pope preſided, ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating his Power was one of the chief oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions that the World had for a Council: And while Chriſtendom was in ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, and the Emperour and the King of <hi>France</hi> were engaged in War, it was not a fit time for one to be called. The Pope had refuſed it long; and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture was choſen, in which the Biſhops could not come to it, that ſo a packt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops might do what they pleaſed, under the name of a General Council: But the World would be no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cozened. No credit was due to a Pope's ſafe Conduct, for they had often broken their Oaths, as to himſelf in particular: And notwithſtanding his former kindneſs to that See, they had been for three Years, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up all the Princes in Chriſtendom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. He proteſted againſt all Councils called by the Pope; but declared, He would be ready to concur with other Chriſtian Princes for calling one, when it ſhould be convenient: And in the mean
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170737:106"/>while, he would maintain all the Articles of the Faith; and loſe his Life and Crown ſooner than ſuffer any of them to be put down. Three Years after this, the King made a new Proteſtation to the ſame effect, when the Council was ſummoned to meet at <hi>Vincenza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reginald Pool</hi> began at this ſame time to raiſe that Oppoſition to the King,

                  </note> which proved ſo fatal to all his Family. He was by his Mother deſcended from the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Brother to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth; and was by his Father likewiſe, the King's near Kinſman. To this high Quality, there was joined a great Sweetneſs of Temper, and a Diſpoſition for Letters, which the King cheriſhed much, and gave him the Deanry of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and ſome other Preferments, in order to the carrying on of his Studies, being reſolved to advance him to the higheſt Dignities in the Church. He lived many Years, both at <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua.</hi> In the latter of theſe, he joined himſelf to a Society of Learned Men, that gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much to the Study of Eloquence, and of the Roman Authors, among whom were <hi>Contareno, Bembo, Caraffa,</hi> and <hi>Sadoletti,</hi> all afterwards honoured with the Scarlet; but <hi>Pool</hi> was eſteemed the moſt Eloquent of of them all. When he was at <hi>Paris,</hi> he firſt incurred the King's Diſpleaſure, for he refuſed to joyn with thoſe whom he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied, in order to the procuring the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of the French Univerſities for the Divorce. Yet after that, he came
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170737:107"/>to <hi>England,</hi> and was preſent when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation declared the King to be their <hi>Supream Head:</hi> And it is probable, that he joined in it, for he kept his Deanry ſome Years after this, which it is not likely would have been granted him, if he had not done that. The King ſuffered him after that to go beyond Sea, but could never draw him over again. Some time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he wrote plainly to the King, that he condemned both his Divorce, and his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Apoſtolick See. The King upon that, ſent him a Book writ by <hi>Sampſon,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> in defence of theſe things, and that ſet him on writing his Book, <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nione Eccleſiaſtica,</hi> which was printed this Year. It was full of ſharp Reflections on the King, whom he compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> It tended much to depreſs the Regal, and to exalt the Papal Authority. And in Concluſion, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to the Emperour, praying him, rather to turn his Arms againſt the King, than the Turk. It was very Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wrote; but there was little Learning or Reaſoning in it; and it was full of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies in the Language, that he beſtowed not only on <hi>Sampſon,</hi> but on the King. The King required him to come over, but that was not to be expected, after he had made ſuch a ſtep. So he deveſted him of all his Dignities; but that recommended him to a Cardinal's Hat. <hi>Stokesly,</hi> and <hi>Tonſtal,</hi> wrote him a long and learned Letter, in the King's Vindication. <hi>Gary
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170737:107"/>diner</hi> wrote alſo his Book, <hi>de vera Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia;</hi> to which, <hi>Bonner</hi> prefixed a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Preface againſt the Pope's Power, and for juſtifying the King's Supremacy. The King's anger at <hi>Pool</hi> could not reach him, but it fell Heavy on his Kindred.</p>
               <p>Viſitors were appointed to ſurvey all the leſſer Monaſteries:
<note place="margin">The leſſer Monaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies cited in</note> They were requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry along with them the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Gentry near them, and to examine the eſtate of their Revenues and Goods, and take Inventories of them; and to take their Seals into their keeping: They were to try how many of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious would take Capacities, and return to a Secular Courſe of Life; and theſe were to be ſent to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> or the Lord Chancellour for them; and an Allowance was to be given them for their Journey: But thoſe who intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to continue in that ſtate, were to be ſent to ſome of the great Monaſteries that lay next. A Penſion was alſo to be aſſigned to the Abbot, or Prior, during Life: And of all this, they were to make their report by <hi>Michaelmaſs:</hi> And they were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to examine what Leaſes had been made all the laſt Year. The Abbots hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what was coming on them, had been raiſing all the Mony they could; and ſo it was intended to recover what was made away by ill Bargains. There were great Complaints made of the Proceedings of the Viſitors, of their Violencies and Briberies; and perhaps not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170737:108"/>Ten Thouſand of the Religious were ſet to ſeek for their Livings, with Forty Shillings and a Gown a Man. Their Goods and Plate were eſtimated at an 100000 <hi>l.</hi> And the valued Rents of their Houſes was 32000 <hi>l.</hi> but was really above ten times ſo much. The Churches and Cloiſters were in moſt places pulled down, and the Materials ſold.</p>
               <p>This gave a general Diſcontent;
<note place="margin">Which gave a general Diſcontent</note> and the Monks were now as much pitied, as they were formerly hated. It was thought ſtrange to ſee the King devour what his Anceſtors had dedicated to the Honour of God, and his Saints. The Nobility and Gentry, who provided for their younger Children, or Friends, by putting them in thoſe Sanctuaries, were ſenſible of their Loſs. The People who had been fed at the Abbot's Tables, and as they travelled over the Country, found the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies to be places of Reception to Strangers, ſaw what they were to loſe. But the more Superſtitious, who thought their Friends muſt now ly ſtill in Purgatory, without that Relief which the Maſſes procured them, were out of meaſure offended at theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. The Books that were publiſhed of the Diſorders in theſe Houſes, had no great effect on the People: For it was ſaid, There was no reaſon to deſtroy whole Houſes for the ſake of ſome vicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who ought to have been driven out of them, and puniſhed. But to remove this general diſcontent, <hi>Cromwel</hi> adviſed the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170737:108"/>King to ſell theſe Lands at very eaſy Rates, to the Nobility and Gentry, and to oblige them to keep up the wonted Hoſpitality. This would both be grateful to them, and would engage them to aſſiſt the Crown in the Maintenance of the changes that had been made; ſince their own Intereſts would be Interwoven with the Rights of Crown; and the commoner ſort, whoſe grudges lay chiefly in their Stomachs, for the want of the good Dinners they uſed to find, would be eaſily pacified if theſe were ſtill kept up. And upon a Clauſe in the Act empowering the King to found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, ſuch Houſes as he ſhould think fit; there were 15 Monaſteries, and 16 Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries, new founded. It ſeems theſe had been more regular than the reſt; ſo that for a while they were reprived, till the General Suppreſſion came, that they fell with the reſt. They were bound to obey ſuch Rules as the King ſhould ſend them; and to pay him Tenths, and firſt Fruits. But all this did not ſo pacify the People, but there was ſtill a great out-cry. The Clergy ſtudied much to inflame the Nation; and built much on this, That an Heretical Prince depoſed by the Pope, was no more to be acknowledged, which had been for 500 Years received as an Article of Faith, and was decreed in the ſame Council, that Eſtabliſhed Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and had been received and caried down from <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh's time, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that it was a part of the Papal
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170737:109"/>Power to depoſe Kings, and give away their Dominions, and had it been oft put in Practice in almoſt all the Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſome that had been raiſers of great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dititions had been Canonized for it. The Pope had ſummoned the King to appear at <hi>Rome,</hi> and anſwer for putting away his Queen and taking another Wife, for the Laws he had made againſt the Church, and for putting the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and others to death for their not obeying them; if he did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear nor reform theſe things, he excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated and deprived him, abſolved his Subjects from their Obedience, diſſolved his Leagues with Forreign Princes, and put the Kingdom under an Interdict. But tho the force of theſe Thunders was in this Age much abated, yet they had not quite loſt their Strength; and the Clergy reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make the moſt of them that could be.</p>
               <p>Some Injunctions which were given by <hi>Cromwell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given by the King.</note> increaſed this ill Diſpoſition. They were to this Effect: All Church-men were required every Sunday for a quarter of a Year, and twice every Quarter after that, to preach againſt the Pope's Power, and aſſert the King's Supremacy, and to explain the Articles lately ſet forth by the Convocation; and to publiſh the Abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome Holy-days in Harveſt time: They were no more to extol Images, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, or Pilgrimages; but to exhort the People to do Works of Charity inſtead of them: And they were required to teach the People the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170737:109"/>the Ten Commandments in Engliſh, and to explain theſe carefully, and inſtruct the Children well in them. They were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Divine Offices reverently, and to have good Curats to ſupply their rooms when they were abſent. They were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not to go to Ale-houſes, or ſit too long at Games; but to ſtudy the Scriptures much, and be exemplary in their Lives: Thoſe that did not reſide, were to give the fortieth part of their Income to the Poor, and for every 100 <hi>l.</hi> a year that any had, they were to maintain a Scholar at ſome Gramar-School, or the Univerſity: and if the Parſonage-houſe was in decay, they were ordered to apply a fifth part of their Benefice for repairing it. Such as did not obey theſe Injunctions, were to be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and their mean Profits were to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred. The Clergy deteſted this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of the King's giving Injunctions without the Concurrence of a Convocation, and by which, they ſaid, they would be made Slaves to his <hi>Vicegerent:</hi> they alſo complained of thoſe heavy Taxes that were laid on them, and that Images, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and Pilgrimages would be now brought under great Contempt. Both the Secular and Regular Clergy were ſo ſenſibly concerned in theſe things, that they inflamed the People all they could. The great Abbots were not wanting for their ſhare to ſet that on, they were now op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with the Crouds of thoſe who were ſent to them from the ſuppreſt Houſes, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170737:110"/>they expected to fall next; nor were their Fears removed by a Letter that was ſent about in the King's Name for ſilencing all Reports that were given out of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to ſuppreſs them; this rather encreaſed than leſſened their Jealouſie.</p>
               <p>The People continued quiet till they had reaped their Harveſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in</hi> Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire.</note> but in the beginning of <hi>October</hi> 20000 roſe in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> led by a Prieſt, diſguiſed into a Cobler. They took an Oath to be true to God, the King, and the Common-wealth, and ſent a Paper of their Grievances to the King. They <q rend="inline">complained of ſome Acts of Parliament, of the ſuppreſſing of many Religious Houſes, of mean and ill Counſellours, and bad Biſhops; and prayed the King to addreſs their Grievances by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Nobility: but yet they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him to be their Supream Head, and that the Tenths and firſt Fruits of Livings belonged to him of right.</q> The King ſent the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> to raiſe Forces againſt them, and gave an Anſwer to their Petition. <q rend="inline">He ſaid it belonged not to the Rabble to direct Princes what Counſellours they ſhould chooſe. The Religious Houſes were ſuppreſt by Law, and the Heads of them had under their Hands confeſſed ſuch horrid Scandals, that they were a Reproach to the Nation; and ſince in many of them there were not above four, and that they waſted their Rents in riotous living, it was much better to apply them to the common good
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170737:110"/>of the Nation, than leave them in ſuch hands; he required them to ſubmit to his Mercy, and to put two hundred of their Leaders into the hands of his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants.</q> The Clergy having brought ſo many together, did all they could to put Heat and Spirit in them, they perſwaded them that if they did not maintain their Faith and their Liberties, both would be loſt. Some of the Gentry were forced to joyn with them for their own Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and they ſent Advices to the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> to procure from the King, the offer of a General Pardon, which would effectually diſſipate them.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time there was a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable riſing in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Another in</hi> York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> which being in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was like to draw Aſſiſtance from that Kingdom: tho their King was then gone into <hi>France,</hi> to marry <hi>Francis</hi>'s Daughter; this inclined the King to make more haſte to ſettle mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>Lincolnſhire;</hi> he ſent them ſecret Aſſurances of Mercy, which wrought on the greateſt part, ſo they diſperſed themſelves, and the moſt obſtinate went to over them in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> The Cobler, and ſome others, were taken and executed. The diſtance that thoſe in the <hi>North,</hi> were at from the Court gave them time to riſe, and form themſelves into ſome Method: One <hi>Ask</hi> commanded in chief, and performed his part with great Dexterity: their March was called <hi>The Pilgrimage of Grace;</hi> they had in their Banners and on their Sleeves,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170737:111"/>the five Wounds of Chriſt: they took an Oath that they would reſtore the Church, ſuppreſs Hereticks, preſerve the King and his Iſſue, and drive baſe-born Men and ill Counſellours from him. They became 40000 ſtrong in a few days, and met with no Oppoſition, they forced the Arch-biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Darcy</hi> to ſwear their Covenant, and to go along with them. They beſieged <hi>Skipton,</hi> but the Earl of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> made it good againſt them: Sir <hi>Ralph Evers</hi> held out <hi>Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> Caſtle, tho for twenty days he and his Men had no Proviſions but Bread and Water. There was alſo a riſing in all the other Northern Counties, againſt whom the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> made Head; and the King ſent ſeveral of the Nobility to his Aſſiſtance, and within a few days the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> marched with ſome Troops, and joyned him. They poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> and reſolved to keep that paſs till the reſt of the Forces that the King had ordered to be ſummoned, ſhould come up to them; for they were not in a Condition to engage with ſuch numbers of deſperate Men; and it was very likely that if they met with any ill Accident, the People might have riſen about them every where; ſo the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> reſolved to keep cloſe at <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> and let the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Rage of the Rebels ſpend, and then with the help of a little time, they might probably fall into Factions, and melt away. They had now fallen to 30000,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170737:111"/>but the King's Army was not above 5000. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> propoſed a Treaty, and made ſome go among them as Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and ſpread Reports that their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were making Terms for themſelves. They were perſwaded to ſend their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Court, and the King to make them more ſecure, diſcharged a Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz that he had appointed at <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and ſent them a general Pardon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſix by name, and reſerving four to be afterwards named; but this put them all in ſuch Apprehenſions, that it made them more reſolved and deſperate: Yet the King to give his People ſome Content, put out Injunctions, requiring the Clergy to continue the uſe of all the Ceremonies of the Church: 300 were imployed to carry the Rebels Demands to the King; <q rend="inline">Which were a General Pardon, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be held at <hi>York;</hi> and that Courts of Juſtice ſhould be ſet up there; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that ſome Acts of Parliament might be repealed, that the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> might be reſtored to her Right of Succeſſion, and the Pope to his wonted Juriſdiction; that the Monaſteries might be again ſet up; that <hi>Audley</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> might be put from the King, and that ſome of the Viſitors might be impriſoned for their Bribery and Extortion.</q> But theſe being rejected, the Rebels took heart again, upon which the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> adviſed the King to gentle Methods; he in his Heart wiſhed that all their Demands might
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170737:112"/>be granted; and the Ld <hi>Darcy</hi> did accuſe him afterwards as if he had encouraged them to make them. The King ſent him a general Pardon without any Exceptions, to be made uſe of as he ſaw Cauſe. The Rebels finding that with the loſs of time, they loſt Heart, reſolved to fall upon him and beat him from <hi>Doncaſter:</hi> but at two ſeveral times, in which they had reſolved to paſs the River, ſuch Rains fell out as made it unpaſſable, which was magnified as next to a Miracle, and made great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on the Rebels Minds. The King ſent a long Anſwer to their Demands, he <q rend="inline">aſſured them he would live and dye in the Defence of the Chriſtian Faith: but the Rabble ought not to preſcribe to him, and to the Convocation in that matter; he anſwered that which concerned the Monaſteries, as he had done to the Men of <hi>Lincolnſhire.</hi> For the Laws, a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude muſt not pretend to alter what was eſtabliſhed; he had governed them now 28 Years, his Subjects had enjoyed great Safety, and been very gently uſed by him in all that time. It was given out that when he began to raign, he had many of the Nobility in his Council, and that he had then none but Men meanly born; this was falſe, for he found but two Noble-Men of his Council, and at preſent there were 7 Temporal Lords, and 4 Biſhops in it. It was neceſſary to have ſome that knew the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and Treaties with Forreign Princes, which made him
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170737:112"/>call <hi>Audley</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> to the Board. If they had any Complaints to make of any about him,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1537"/> he was ready to hear them; but he would not ſuffer them to direct him what Counſellours he ought to employ: nor could they judg of the Biſhops that were promoted, who were not known to them; he charged them not to believe Lies, nor be governed by Incendiaries, but to ſubmit to his Mercy.</q> On the 9th of <hi>December,</hi> he ſigned a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of Pardon without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions.</p>
               <p>When this was known,
<note place="margin">They are every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted.</note> and the Rage of the People cooled, they were willing to lay hold on it, and all the Artifices that ſome of the Clergy and their Leaders could uſe, had no other Effect but to draw as many together as brought them under new Guilt, and made them forfeit the benefit of the King's Pardon. Many came in and renewed their Oaths of Allegiance, and promiſing all Obedience for the future. <hi>Ask</hi> was invited to the Court and well uſed by the King, on deſign to learn from him all the ſecret Correſpondencies they had in the other parts of the Kingdom, for the Diſpoſition to Rebel was general, only they were not all alike forward in it. It was in particular believed that the great Abbots cheriſhed it, for which ſome of them were afterwards attained. <hi>Darcy</hi> pleaded his great Age, being then fourſcore, and the Eminent Service he had done the Crown for fifty Years together, and that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170737:113"/>he was forced for his own Preſervation to go along with the Rebels; but yet he was put in Priſon. This gave the Clergy Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to infuſe it in the People, that the Pardon would not be well kept: So 8000 run together again, and thought to have ſurprized <hi>Carlile,</hi> but the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> fell on them and routed them, and by Martial Law hanged their Captains, and 70 other Perſons. Others thought to have ſurprized <hi>Hull,</hi> but were likewiſe routed, and many of them were hanged. Many other little Riſings were quickly diſperſed; and ſuch was the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, that he was every where upon them before they could grow to any Number: and before the end of <hi>January,</hi> the Country was abſolutely quieted. <hi>Ask</hi> left the Court without leave, but was ſoon retaken and hanged at <hi>York.</hi> The Lord <hi>Darcy</hi> and <hi>Huſſy</hi> were arraigned at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and condemned by their Peers, the one for the <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and the other for the <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> Inſurrections. <hi>Darcy</hi> was beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill:</hi> his old Age and former Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices made him to be much lamented. <hi>Huſſy</hi> was beheaded at <hi>Lincoln. Darcy</hi> accuſed the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> but he deſired a Trial by Combate upon it, yet the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had lately done were ſuch, that the King would not ſeem to have any Jealouſy of him. After theſe and ſeveral other Executions were over, the King proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a General Oblivion in <hi>July,</hi> by which the Nation was again put in a quiet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170737:113"/>and this threatning Storm was now quite diſſipated.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as it was over, the King went on more reſolutely in his Deſign of ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Monaſteries: for he was now leſs apprehenſive of any new Commotions, after ſo many had been ſo happily quaſht and that the chief Incendiaries had ſuffered.</p>
               <p>A new Viſitation was appointed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Converſation of the Monks,
<note place="margin">The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the King.</note> to examine how they ſtood affected to the Pope, and how they promoted the King's Supremacy. They were likewiſe ordered to examine what Impoſtures might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, either in Images or Relicks, by which the Superſtition of the credulous People was wrought on. Some few Houſes of greater value, were prevailed with the former Year to ſurrender to the King. Many of the Houſes that had not bin diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, tho they were within the former Act, were now ſuppreſt, and many of the greater Abbots were wrought on to ſurrender by ſeveral Motives: Some had been faulty during the Rebellion, and ſo to prevent a Storm, offered a Reſignation. Others liked the Reformation, and did it on that account: ſome were found guilty of great Diſorders in their Lives, and to prevent a ſhameful Diſcovery, offered their Houſes to the King; and others had made ſuch Waſts and Dilapidations, that having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Care of themſelves, they were leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for others. At St. <hi>Albans,</hi> the Rents were let ſo low, that the Abbot
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170737:114"/>could not maintain the Charge of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. At <hi>Battel,</hi> the whole Furniture of the Houſe and Chappel was not above an 100 <hi>l.</hi> in value, and their Plate was not 300 <hi>l.</hi> In ſome Houſes there was ſcarce any Plate or Furniture left. Many Abbots and Monks were glad to accept of a Penſion for Life, and that was proportioned to the value of their Houſe, and to their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. The Abbots of St. <hi>Albans</hi> and <hi>Tewkesbury,</hi> had 400 Marks a Year: The Abbots of St. <hi>Edmondsbury</hi> was more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and more reſolute: The Viſitors wrote that they found no Scandals in that Houſe: but at laſt he was prevailed with by a Penſion of 500 Marks to reſign. The Inferiour Governours had ſome 30, 20, or 10 <hi>l.</hi> Penſions, and the Monks had general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 6 <hi>l.</hi> or 8 Marks a piece. If any Abbot died, the new Abbot (they being choſen as the Biſhops were upon a <hi>Conge delire,</hi> and a Miſſive Letter) was named for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, only to reſigne the Houſe. And all were made to hope for Advancement, that ſhould give good Example to others by a quick and cheerful Surrender: by theſe means 121 of thoſe Houſes were this Year reſigned to the King. In moſt Houſes the Viſitor made the Monks ſign a Confeſſion of their former Vices and Diſorders, of which there is only one Original Extant, that eſcaped a general Raſure of all ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time; in which they acknowledged in a long Narrative, their <q rend="inline">former Idleneſs, Gluttony, and Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170737:114"/>for which the pit of Hell was ready to ſwallow them up. Others acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that they were ſenſible that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their former pretended Religion conſiſted in ſome dumb Ceremonies, by which they were blindly led, having no true Knowledg of God's Laws, but that they had procured Exemption from their Dioceſans, and had ſubjected themſelves wholly to a Forreign Power, that took no care to reform their Abuſes; and therefore ſince the moſt perfect way of Life was revealed by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and that it was fit they ſhould be governed by the King, their <hi>Supream Head,</hi> they reſigned to him.</q> Of this ſort I have ſeen ſix. Some reſigned in hopes that the King would found them of new; theſe favoured the Reformation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to convert their Houſes to better Uſes, for preaching, ſtudy, and Prayer; and <hi>Latimer</hi> preſt <hi>Cromwell</hi> earneſtly, that two or three Houſes might be reſerved for ſuch purpoſes in every County. But it was reſolved to ſuppreſs all, and therefore neither could the Interceſſions of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> nor of the Viſitors, preſerve the Nunnery at <hi>Godſtow,</hi> tho they found great Strictneſs of Life in it, and it was the common place of the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of young Women of Quality in that County. The common Preamble to moſt Surrenders was, <q rend="inline">That upon full Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and of their own proper Motion, for juſt and reaſonable Cauſes, moving
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170737:115"/>their Conſciences;</q> they did freely give up their Houſes to the King. Some ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred without any Preamble, to the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors as Feofees in truſt for the King. In ſhort, they went on at ſuch a rate, that 159 Reſignations were obtained before the Parliament met, and of theſe the Originals of 154 are yet extant. Some thought that theſe Reſignations could not be valid, ſince the Incumbents had not the Property, but only the Truſt for life of thoſe Houſes. But the Parliament did afterwards declare them good in Law. It was alſo ſaid, that they being of the Nature of Corporations, all Deeds under their Seals were valid; and that at leaſt by their Reſignation and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Houſes, they forfeited them to the King. But this was thought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt rather on a Nicety in Law, than natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Equity.</p>
               <p>Others were more roughly handled.
<note place="margin">Some Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted.</note> The Prior of <hi>Wooburn</hi> was ſuſpected of a Correſpondence with the Rebels, and of favouring the Pope; he was dealt with to ſubmit to the King, and he was prevailed on to do it, but was not eaſie in it once, nor fixed to it; <q rend="inline">He complained that the new Preachers detracted from the Honour due to the Virgin and Saints; he thought the Religion was changed, and wondered that the Judgments of God on Q. <hi>Anne,</hi> had not terrified others from going on to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Faith.</q> When the Rebellion broke out, he joined in it, as did alſo the Abbots of <hi>Whaley, Garvaux,</hi> and <hi>Sawley,</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:170737:115"/>and the Prior of <hi>Burlington,</hi> all theſe were all taken, and attainted of Treaſon, and executed. The Abbots of <hi>Glaſſenbury</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> had alſo ſent a great deal of their Plate to the Rebels, the former to diſguiſe it the better, had made one break into the Houſe where the Plate was kept: So he was convicted both of Burglary and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and at his Execution he confeſſed his Crime, and begged both God's and the King's Pardon for it. The Abbot of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> was alſo attainted, and executed; but the Grounds of it are not known: for the Records of their Attaindors are loſt. Theſe had over and over again taken the Oaths, in which they acknowledged the King to be <hi>Supream Head of the Church,</hi> and were preſent in thoſe Parliaments in which the ſeveral Acts about it were paſs'd, and did not diſſent to them; and ſince they made no Oppoſition, when they might ſafely and legally do it, there is no Reaſon to think they would have done it afterwards, when it was more dangerous and criminal: So that all thoſe who have repreſented them as having ſuffered for denying the King's Supremacy, have therein ſhewed their Unacquaintedneſs with the Journals of Parliament. The Abbot of <hi>Reading</hi> had complied ſo far, that he was grown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Favour with <hi>Cromwell;</hi> ſo that in ſome Conteſts between <hi>Shaxton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> and him, the Biſhop, who was a proud ill-natured Man, complained that <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſupported the Abbot againſt him, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170737:116"/>writ upon that a very Inſolent, Expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Letter to him; which <hi>Cromwell</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with great ſtrength of Reaſon and Decency of Stile; by which it appears that heighth of his Condition, had no other Effect on him, but to make him know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others better. Upon the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of thoſe Abbots, their Abbies were ſeized on; and this was thought a great ſtretch both in Law and Equity: for it ſeemed not reaſonable, if an Incumbent was faulty, for that to ſeize on his Benefice, which upon his Attainder ought to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue entire, and paſs to the next Succeſſor, as if he were really dead. But a Clauſe was put in the Act of Treaſon, 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8, That <hi>whatſoever Lands of Eſtate of Inheritance, any that ſhould be convicted of Treaſon, had in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe or Poſſeſſion by any Right or manner, ſhould be forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the King.</hi> By which, as intailed Eſtates were certainly comprehended, ſo it ſeems they applied it likewiſe to Church-Benefices: yet when the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> was attainted, this was not thought on. The words, <hi>Eſtate of Inheritance,</hi> ſeemed to exclude Church-Lands, but the mention that was made of Traitors <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> that were cut off as well as their <hi>Heirs,</hi> ſeemed on the other hand to include Eſtates, to which Succeſſors might come in a Traitor's room, as well as thoſe which deſcended by Inheritance. The Words were ambiguous, and were ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to juſtify thoſe Seizures; and therefore in an Act of Treaſons made in the next Reign, this was more cautiouſly worded:
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170737:116"/>for it was provided that Traitors ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the Eſtates which they poſſeſſed <hi>in their own Right.</hi> But whatſoever Illegality there might be in theſe Proceedings, they were confirmed by the following Parliament, in a ſpecial <hi>Proviſo</hi> made concerning thoſe Abbies that were ſeized on by any Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Treaſon. Many of the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> were executed for denying the King's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy: Others were alſo ſuſpected of favouring them, and of receiving Books ſent from beyond Sea, againſt the King's Proceedings, and were ſhut up in their Cells, in which moſt of them died. The Prior was a Man of extraordinary Charity and Good-Works, as the Viſitor reported: But he was made reſign with this Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <q rend="inline">That many of the Houſe had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the King, and deſerved that their Lives ſhould be taken, and their Goods confiſcated; and therefore to avoid that, they ſurrendered their Houſes.</q> Great Complaints were made of the Viſitors, as if they had uſed undue Practices to make the Abbots and Monks ſurrender: and it was ſaid, that they had in many Places embe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell'd much of the Plate to their own Uſes; and in particular, it was complained that Dr. <hi>London</hi> had corrupted many Nuns. They on the other hand, publiſhed many of the vile Practices that they found in thoſe Houſes, ſo that ſeveral Books very indecently writ, were printed upon this Occaſion; but on ſo foul a Subject it is not fit to ſtand long. No Story became ſo
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170737:117"/>publick as that of the Prior of the croſſed Friers in <hi>London,</hi> who was found in bed with a Whore at Noon-day: He fell down on his Knees, and beg'd, that they who ſurpriſed him, would not diſcover his ſhame: They made him give them 30 <hi>l.</hi> which he proteſted was all he had; and he promiſed them as much more: But he not keeping his word to them, a Suit followed upon it. Yet all theſe perſonal Blemiſhes did not work much on the People. It ſeemed unreaſonable to extinguiſh Noble Foundations, for the fault of ſome Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals: Therefore another way was taken, which had a better effect.</p>
               <p>They diſcovered many Impoſtures about Relicks,
<note place="margin">The Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</note> and wonderful Images, to which, Pilgrimages had been wont to be made. At <hi>Reading</hi> they had an Angel's Wing, which brought over the Spear's Point that pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced our Saviour's Side: As many pieces of the Croſs were found, as joined together, would have made a big Croſs. The Rood of Grace at <hi>Boxley</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> had been much eſteemed, and drawn many Pilgrims to it: It was obſerved to bow, and roul its Eyes; and look at times well pleaſed, or angry; which the credulous Multitude im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to a Divine Power: But all this was diſcovered to be a Cheat, and it was brought up to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs; and all the Springs were openly ſhewed, that governed its ſeveral Motions. At <hi>Hales</hi> in <hi>Gloceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> the Blood of Chriſt was ſhewed in a Vial; and it was believed, that none
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170737:117"/>could ſee it who were in mortal Sin: And ſo after good Preſents were made, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Pilgrims went way well ſatisfied if they had ſeen it. This was the Blood of a Duck renewed every Week, put in a Vial very thick of one ſide, as thin on the other; and either ſide turned towards the Pilgrim, as the Prieſts were ſatisfied with their Oblations: Several other ſuch like Impoſtures were diſcovered, which contributed much to the undeceiving the People.</p>
               <p>The richeſt Shrine in <hi>England</hi> was <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac Beckets</hi> at <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Becket's <hi>Shrine broken.</hi>
                  </note> whoſe Story is well known. After he had long imbroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>England,</hi> and ſhewed that he had a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſo turned to Faction, that he could not be at quiet; ſome of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's Officious Servants killed him in the Church of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> He was preſently Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized, and held in greater eſteem than any other Saint whatſoever; ſo much more was a Martyr for the Papacy valued, than any that ſuffered for the Chriſtian Religion: And his Altar drew far greater Oblations, than thoſe that were dedicated to Chriſt, or the bleſſed Virgin; as appears by the accounts of two of their Years. In one, 3 <hi>l.</hi> 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> And in another, not a Penny was offered at Chriſt's Altar. There was in the one, 63 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> and in the other, 4 <hi>l.</hi> 1 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> offered at the Bleſſed Virgin's Altar. But in theſe very Years there was, 832 <hi>l.</hi> 12 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> and 964 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Altar. The Shrine
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170737:118"/>grew to be of ineſtimable Value. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Seventh of <hi>France</hi> came over in Pilgrimage to viſit it, and offered a Stone, valued to be the richeſt in Europe. He had not only one Holy Day, the 29th of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> called his Martyrdom; but alſo the Day of his Tranſlation, the 7th of <hi>July,</hi> was alſo a Holy Day; and every 50th Year there was a Jubily, and an Indulgence, granted to all that came and viſited his Tomb: And ſometimes there were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be 100000 Pilgrims there on that Occaſion. It is hard to tell whether the Hatred to his ſeditious Practices, or the Love of his Shrine, ſet on King <hi>Henry</hi> more to Unſaint him. His Shrine was broken, and the Gold of it was ſo heavy, that it filled two Cheſts, which took Eight men a piece to carry them out of the Church; and his Skull, which had been ſo much worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, was proved to be an Impoſture; for the true Skull was with the reſt of his Bones in his Coffin; his Bones were either burnt, as it was given out at <hi>Rome;</hi> or ſo mixed with other Bones, as our Writers ſay; that it had been a Miracle indeed to have diſtinguiſhed them afterwards. The King called at this time, a Meeting of the Clergy, of 10 Biſhops, 8 Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, and 17 Divines and Canoniſts; and made them finiſh an Explanation of the Chriſtian Religion. But this was afterwards digeſted into a better form, as ſhall be told in its proper place.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:170737:118"/>
               <p>When all theſe things were known at <hi>Rome,</hi> all the Eloquent Pens there were imploied to repreſent King <hi>Henry</hi> as the moſt Sacrilegious Tyrant that ever was;
<note place="margin">The Pope thunders againſt the King,</note> that made War with Chriſts Vicar on Earth, and his Saints in Heaven; and he was compared to the worſt Princes that ever reigned; to <hi>Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Belſhazzar, Nero,</hi> and <hi>Diocletian;</hi> but the <hi>Parallel</hi> with <hi>Julian,</hi> the Apoſtate, was moſt inſiſted on. It was ſaid, He copied after him in all things, ſave only, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were worſe. In many of theſe, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Pool</hi>'s Stile was pretended to be known; and they were all at leaſt much encouraged by him, which provoked the King to hate him moſt Implacably. The Pope went further; for now he publiſhed all thoſe Thunders, with which he had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him three Years before. <q rend="inline">He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, That as God's Vicar, he had power to root out, and to deſtroy; and had Authority over all the Kings in the World: And therefore, after he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerated all the King's Crimes, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired himſelf to appear within 90 days, at <hi>Rome,</hi> either in Perſon, or by Proxy, and all his Complices within 60 Days; and if he and they did not appear, he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to have fallen from his Crown; and them from their Eſtates. He put the Kingdom under an Interdict; and abſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Subjects from their Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance: He declared him and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, Infamous; and put their Children
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170737:119"/>under Incapacities. He required all the Clergy to go out of <hi>England,</hi> within 5 Days after the time prefixed ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; leaving only ſo many as might ſerve for Baptizing Children, or giving the Sacrament to ſuch as died in Penitence. He charged all his Subjects to riſe in Arms againſt him, and that none ſhould aſſiſt him. He abſolved all other Princes from their Confederacies with him, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted them to have no more Commerce with him. He required all Chriſtians to make War on him; and to ſeize on the Perſons and Goods of all his Subjects; and make Slaves of them. He charged all Biſhops to publiſh the Sentence with due Solemnities; and ordained it to be affixed at <hi>Rome, Tournay</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk.</hi>
                  </q> This was firſt given out the 30 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1535; but it had been all this while ſuſpended, till the Suppreſſion of the Monaſteries, and the burning of <hi>Becket</hi>'s Bones, did ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the Pope, that he reſolved to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear going to Extremities no longer. So on the 17 of <hi>December</hi> this Year, the Pope publiſhed the Bull, which he ſaid he had ſo long ſuſpended at the Interceſſion of ſome Princes; who hoped that King <hi>Henry</hi> might have been reclaimed by gentler Methods; and therefore ſince it appeared that he grew ſtill worſe and worſe, he was forced to proceed to his Fulminations. By this Sentence it is certain, That either the Popes Infallibility, muſt be confeſſed to be a Cheat put upon the World, or if any
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170737:119"/>believe it, they muſt acknowledge, that the Power of depoſing Princes, is really lodged in that Chair: For this was not a ſudden fit of Paſſion, but was done <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> with all the Deliberation they ever admit of. The Sentence was in ſome particulars without a Precedent; but as to the main Points of depoſing the King, and abſolving his Subjects from their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, there was abundance of Inſtances to be brought in theſe laſt 500 Years, to ſhew that this had been all along aſſerted the Right of the Papacy. The Pope writ alſo to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> with deſign to inflame them againſt King <hi>Henry:</hi> And if this had been an Age of <hi>Croiſſades,</hi> no doubt there had been one undertaken againſt him; for it was held to be as merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, if not more, to make War on him, than on the Turk. But now the Thunders of the <hi>Vatican</hi> had loſt their force.</p>
               <p>The King got all the Biſhops,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of</hi> England <hi>aſſert the King's Power, and the Nature of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</hi>
                  </note> and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Divines of <hi>England,</hi> to ſign a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration againſt all Church-men, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the Power of the Sword, or to Authority over Kings; and that all that aſſumed ſuch Powers, were Subverters of the Kingdom of Chriſt. Many of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops did alſo ſign another Paper, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Limits of the Regal and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Power, that both had their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from God, for ſeveral Ends, and different Natures; and that Princes were ſubject to the Word of God, as well as Biſhops ought to be obedient to their Laws.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170737:120"/>There was alſo another Declaration made, ſigned by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the 2 Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, 11 Biſhops, and 20 Divines; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the Diſtinction betwen the Power of the Keys, and the Power of the Sword. The former was not abſolute, but limited by the Scripture. Orders were decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be a Sacrament inſtituted by Chriſt, which were conferred by Prayer, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands. And that in the New Teſtament, no mention was made of any other Ranks, but of Deacons, or Miniſters; and of Prieſts, or Biſhops. After this, the uſe of all the Inferiour Degrees of Lectures, Acolyths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was laid down. Theſe were ſet up about the beginning of the 3d Century; for in the middle of that Age, mention is made of them, both by <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian;</hi> and they were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be degrees of Probation, through which Men were to aſcend to the higher Functions. But the Canoniſts had found out ſo many Diſtinctions of Benefices; and that a ſimple Tonſure, qualified a Man for ſeveral of them; that theſe Inſtitutions became either a matter of Form only, or were made a Colour for Laymen to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs Eccleſiaſtical Benefices. In this, and ſeveral other Books of that time, <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> are ſpoken of, as being both one Office. In the Ancient Church there were different Ordinations, and different Functions belonging to theſe Offices, tho the Superiour was believed to include the Inferiour. But in the latter Ages, both
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170737:120"/>the School-men &amp; Canoniſts ſeemed on diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent grounds to have deſigned to make them appear to be the ſame Office; and that the one was only a higher degree in the ſame Order. The School-men, to magnify Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, extolled the Office, by which that was performed ſo high, and the Canoniſts, to exalt the Pope's Univerſal Authority, depreſt the Office of Biſhops ſo low, to make them ſeem only the Pope's Delegates; and that their Juriſdiction was not from Chriſt, that by theſe means, theſe two Offices were thought ſo near one another, that they differed only in degree: And this was ſo well obſerved at <hi>Trent,</hi> that the Eſtabliſhing the Epiſcopal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as founded on a Divine Right, was apprehended as one of the fatalleſt Blows that could have been given to the Papacy. This being at this time ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received, it is no wonder, if before that matter came to be more exactly inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into, ſome of the Reformers writ more careleſsly in the Explanations they made of theſe Offices, which is ſo far from being an Argument, that they were upon due enquiry of another mind; that it is to be look'd on as a part of the Dregs of Popery, flowing from the belief of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, and the Pope's Supremacy, of which all the Conſequences were not ſo early obſerved.</p>
               <p>This Year the Engliſh Bible was finiſhed.
<note place="margin">The Bible in Engliſh, and new Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> The Tranſlation was ſent over to <hi>Paris</hi> to be printed there, for the Workmen in

                  <hi>England</hi> were not thought able to go about it. <hi>Bonner</hi> was then Embaſſadour in <hi>France;</hi> and he obtained a Licence of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> for printing it; but upon a Complaint made by the French Clergy, the Preſs was ſtopt, and many of the Copies were ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, and burnt. So it was brought over to <hi>England,</hi> and was undertaken, and now finiſhed, by <hi>Grafton.

                  <q rend="inline">and rejoyced to ſee the day of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now riſen in <hi>England,</hi> ſince the Word of God did ſhine over it all, without a Cloud.</q> Not long after this, <hi>Cromwel</hi> gave out Injunctions, requiring the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy <q rend="inline">to ſet up Bibles in their Churches, and to encourage all to read them. He alſo exhorted the People not to diſpute about the ſenſe of difficult places, but to leave that to Men of better Judgments. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents were required to inſtruct the People, and teach them the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in Engliſh: And that once every Quarter there ſhould be a Sermon, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the true Goſpel of Chriſt; and to exhort the People to Works of Charity; and not to truſt to other Men's Works, to Pilgrimages, or Relicts, or the ſaying their Beads, which tended to Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Images, abuſed by Pilgrimages made to them, were to ordered be taken away. No Candle was to be before any Image, but
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170737:121"/>the Crucifix:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1538"/> And they were to teach the People, that it was Idolatry, to make any other uſe of Images, but meerly to put them in minde of thoſe whom they repreſented: And ſuch as had formerly magnified Images, or Pilgrimages, were required openly to recant and confeſs, that they had been led into an Errour, which Covetouſneſs had brought into the Church. All Incumbents were required to keep Regiſters for Chriſtnings, and Marriages; and to teach the People that it were good to omit the Suffrages to the Saints in the Litany.</q> Theſe ſtruck at ſome of the main Points of the former Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, both about Images, Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the Invocation of Saints: But the free Uſe of the Scriptures gave the deadlieſt Blow of all. Yet all the Clergy ſubmitted to them without any Murmuring.</p>

                  </note> and this very much blaſted the Hopes of the Popiſh Party, which were chiefly built on the probability of Lady <hi>Mary</hi>'s ſucceeding to the Crown, which was now ſet at a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſtance. So both <hi>Lee, Gardiner,</hi> and <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſly,</hi> ſeemed to vie with the Biſhops of the other Party, which of them ſhould moſt zealouſly execute the Injunctions, and thereby inſinuate themſelves moſt into the King's Eſteem and Favour. <hi>Gardiner</hi> was ſome Years Ambaſſadour in <hi>France,</hi> but <hi>Cromwel</hi> got <hi>Bonner</hi> to be ſent in his room, who ſeemed then to be the moſt zealous Promoter of the Reformation, that was then
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170737:122"/>in <hi>England.</hi> After that, <hi>Gardiner</hi> was ſent to the Emperour's Court, with Sir <hi>Henry Knevet,</hi> and there he gave ſome occaſion to ſuſpect that he was treating a Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with the Pope's Legate. But the <hi>Italian</hi> that managed it, being ſent with a Meſſage to the Ambaſſadour's Secretary, he miſtook <hi>Knevet</hi>'s Secretary for <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s, and told his Buſineſs to him. <hi>Knevet</hi> tried what could be made of it, but could not carry it far: For the <hi>Italian</hi> was diſowned, and put in Priſon upon it: And <hi>Gardiner</hi> complained of it, as a Trepan laid to ruine him.

               <p>This meeting ſo well with the King's own Perſwaſions about the Corporal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, had a great effect on him; and an
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170737:122"/>occaſion did quickly offer it ſelf to him, to declare his Zeal in that matter. <hi>Lambert</hi> was at that time accuſed before the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> He had been Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to the Factory of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and there he aſſociated himſelf to <hi>Tindall:</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he was ſeized on coming over to <hi>England;</hi> but upon the changes that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, he was ſet at Liberty.

Upon which, the King reſolved to judge him in Perſon, and to manage the Trial with great Solemnity; and for that end, many of the Nobility and Biſhops were ſent for. When the day came, there was a vaſt Appearance. The King's Guards and Cloath of State, were all in White, to make it look the liker a Divine Service. <hi>Lambert</hi> begun with a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, acknowledging the King's great Learning, and his Goodneſs in hearing the Cauſes of his Subjects. The King ſtop'd
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170737:123"/>him, and bad him forbear Flatteries, and ſpeak to the matter: And he argued againſt him from Chriſt's Words, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be his Body. <hi>Lambert</hi> anſwered in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Words, That it <hi>was his Body in a certain manner,</hi> but that a Body could not be in two places at once. To this the King commanded <hi>Cranmer</hi> to ſpeak; and he argued, That ſince Chriſt is ſtill in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and yet he appeared to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that therefore he may be in different places at once. <hi>Lambert</hi> ſaid, That was but a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and was not the very Body of Chriſt. <hi>Tonſtall</hi> argued, That the Divine Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence was not to be meaſured by our Notions, of what was impoſſible. <hi>Stokeſly</hi> argued, That one Subſtance may be changed into another, and yet the Accidents remain: So Water when it boiled, did evaporate in Air, and yet its Moiſture remained. This was received with great Applauſe; tho it was an ill Inference, that becauſe there was an accidental Converſion, therefore there might be a Subſtantial one, in which one Subſtance was annihilated, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther produced in its place. Ten, one after another, diſputed, and their Arguments, with the ſtern Words and Looks that the King interpoſed, together with the length of the Action, in ſo publick an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, put <hi>Lambert</hi> in ſome Confuſion; and upon his Silence, a great Shout of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe followed. In Concluſion, the King asked him if he was not convinced, and whether he would live or die? But he
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170737:123"/>continued firm to his Opinion: So <hi>Cromwel</hi> was commanded to read the Sentence of his Condemnation; and not many days after, it was executed in a moſt barbarous manner, in <hi>Smithfield:</hi> For there was not Fire enough put under him to conſume him ſuddenly; ſo that his Legs and Thighs were burnt away while he was yet alive. He bore it pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and continued to cry out, <hi>None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt.</hi> He was a Man of conſiderable Learning, and of a very good Judgment. The Popiſh Party improved this, and perſwaded the King of the good effects it would have on his People, who would in this ſee his Zeal for the Faith; and they forgot not to magnify all that he had ſaid, as if it had been uttered by an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; which proved him to be both <hi>Defender of the Faith, and Supream Head of the Church.</hi> All this wrought ſo much on the King, that he reſolved to call a Parliament, both for the ſuppreſſing the Monaſteries, and the new Opinions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fox,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Treaties with the</hi> German <hi>Princes.</hi>
                  </note> died at this time: He had been much imploied in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and had ſetled a League between the King and the <hi>German</hi> Princes. The King was acknowledged the Patron of their League, and he ſent them over 100000 Crowns a Year, for the ſupport of it. There was a Religious League alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; but upon the turn that followed in the Court upon Queen <hi>Ann</hi>'s Death, that fell to the ground; and all that was in put their League relating to Religion, was, That
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170737:124"/>they ſhould joyn againſt the Pope as the common Enemy, and ſet up the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion according to the Goſpel. But the Treaty about other Points was afterwards ſet on foot. The King deſired <hi>Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon</hi> to come over; and ſeveral Letters paſſed between them, but he could not be ſpared out of <hi>Germany;</hi> tho he was then invited both to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> ſent over ſome to treat with the King; the Points they inſiſted moſt on were, the granting the Chalice to the People, and the putting down private Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in which the Inſtitution ſeemed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs; the having the Worſhip in a known Tongue, which both common ſenſe, and the Authority of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſeemed to juſtify much. The third was, The Marriage of the Clergy; for they being extream ſenſible of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Families, reckoned, that could not be ſecured, unleſs the Prieſts might marry. Concerning theſe things, their Ambaſſadours gave a long and learned Memorial to the King; to which an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was made, penned by <hi>Tonſtall;</hi> in which the things they complained of, were juſtified by the ordinary Arguments. Upon <hi>Fox</hi>'s Death, <hi>Bonner</hi> was promoted to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford;</hi> and <hi>Stokesly</hi> dying not long after, he was tranſlated to <hi>London. Cromwell</hi> thought that he had raiſed a Man that would be a faithful Second to <hi>Cranmer</hi> in his Deſigns of Reformation, who indeed needed help; not only to ballance the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170737:124"/>made him by other Biſhops, but to leſſen the Prejudices he ſuffered by the Weakneſs and Indiſcretion of his own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who were generally rather Clogs than Helps to him. Great Complaints were brought to the Court of the raſhneſs of the new Preachers, who were flying at many things not yet aboliſhed. Upon this, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were writ to the Biſhops, to take care that as the People ſhould be rightly inſtructed; ſo they ſhould not be offended with too many Novelties. Thus was <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s Intereſt ſo low, that he had none to depend on, but <hi>Cromwell.</hi> There was not a Queen now in the King's Boſom to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them; and therefore <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſet himſelf to contrive how the King ſhould be engaged in ſuch an Alliance with the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> as might prevail with him, both in Affection and Intereſt, to carry on what he had thus begun. And the Beauty of <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve</hi> was ſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, that he ſet himſelf to bring about that Match.</p>
               <p>A Parliament was ſummoned to the 28th of <hi>April,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Act of the ſix Articles.</note> in which twenty of the Abbots ſate in Perſon. On the 5th of <hi>May,</hi> a Motion was made, that ſome might be appointed to draw a Bill, againſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Opinions in matters of Religion; theſe were <hi>Cromwell, Cranmer,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Dureſme, Ely, Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells, Bangor, Carlile,</hi> and <hi>Worceſter;</hi> they were divided in their Minds; and tho the Popiſh Party were ſive to four, yet the Authority that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170737:125"/>
                  <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Cranmer</hi> were in, turned the Ballance a little; but after they had met eleven days, they ended in nothing. Upon that the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> propoſed the ſix Articles; The firſt was for the Corporal Preſence. 2. For Communion in one kind. 3. For obſerving the Vows of Chaſtity. 4. For private Maſſes. 5. For the Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the Clergy. And the ſixth, was for Auricular Confeſſion: Againſt moſt of theſe <hi>Cranmer</hi> argued ſeveral days. It is not like he oppoſed the firſt, both becauſe of that which he had declared in <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Caſe ſo lately, and in his own Opinion, he was then for it; but he had the Words of the Inſtitution, and the conſtant Practice of the Church for twelve Ages to object to the ſecond: and for the third, ſince the Monks were ſet at Liberty to live in the World, it ſeemed hard to reſtrain them from Marriage, and nothing did ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cut off their Pretenſions to their former Houſes, as their being married would do. For the fourth, if private Maſſes were uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, then the King had done very ill to ſuppreſs ſo many Houſes, that were chiefly founded for that end: the Sacrament was alſo by its firſt Inſtitution, and the Practice of the Primitive Church, to be a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and all thoſe private Maſſes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to cheat the World. For the fifth, it touched <hi>Cranmer</hi> in the quick, for it was believed that he was married, but the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments uſed for that will be found in the next Book. For Auricular Confeſſion, <hi>Lee
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170737:125"/>Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Tonſtal,</hi> preſs'd much to have it declared neceſſary by the <hi>Law of God Cranmer</hi> argued againſt this, and ſaid it was only a good and profitable thing. The King came often to the Houſe in Perſon, and diſputed in theſe Points: for the greateſt part he was againſt <hi>Cranmer;</hi> but in this particular he joyned with him. <hi>Tonſtall</hi> drew up all the Quotations, brought from Antient Authors for it, in a Paper which he delivered to the King; the King anſwered in a long Letter, written with his own Hand, in which he ſhewed, that the Fathers did only adviſe Confeſſion, but did not impoſe it as neceſſary: and ſo it was concluded in general, only that it was <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and expedient.</hi> On the 24th of <hi>May,</hi> the Parliament was prorogued a few days, but by a Vote it was provided that the Bills ſhould continue in the ſtate they were then in. At their next meeting, two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees were appointed to draw the Bill of Religion; <hi>Cranmer</hi> was the chief of the one, and <hi>Lee</hi> of the other; both their Draughts were carried to the King, and were in many places corrected with his own Hand; in ſome Parts he writ whole Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods a new. That which <hi>Lee</hi> drew was more agreeable to the King's Opinion; ſo it was brought into the Houſe. <hi>Cranmer</hi> argued three days againſt it, and when it came to the Vote, the King who was much ſet on having it paſt, deſired him to go out, but he excuſed himſelf; for he thought he was bound in Conſcience to vote againſt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170737:126"/>it: But the reſt that oppoſed it, were more compliant, and it alſo paſſed without any conſiderable Oppoſition in the Houſe of Commons, and was aſſented to by the King.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Subſtance of it was, That the King being ſenſible of the good of Union, and of the miſchief of Diſcord, in points of Religion, had come to the Parliament in Perſon, and opened many things of high Learning there; and that with the aſſent of both Houſes, he ſet forth theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in the Sacrament there was no Subſtance of Bread and Wine, but only the Natural Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Chriſt was entirely in each kind, and ſo Communion in both was not neceſſary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Prieſts by the Law of God, ought not to marry.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That Vows of Chaſtity taken after the Age of 21, ought to be kept.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That Private Maſſes were lawful and uſeful.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That Auricular Confeſſion was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and ought to be retained. Such as did ſpeak or write agaiſt the firſt of theſe, were to be burned without the benefit of Abjuration; and it was made Felony to diſpute againſt the other five: and ſuch as did ſpeak againſt them were to be in a <hi>Premunire</hi> for the firſt Offence; the ſecond was made Felony. Married Prieſts that did not put away their Wives, were to be condemned of Fellony, in thoſe that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170737:126"/>lived incontinently, the firſt Offence was a <hi>Premunire,</hi> and the ſecond Felony. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that offended were to be puniſhed as the Prieſts were. Thoſe that contemned Confeſſion and the Sacrament, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from it at the accuſtomed times, were for the firſt Offence in a <hi>Premunire,</hi> the ſecond was Felony. Proceedings were to be made in the Forms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, by Preſentments, and a Jury, and all Church-men were charged to read the Act in their Churches once a Quarter.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This Act was received with great Joy by all the Popiſh Party;
<note place="margin">Cenſures paſt upon it.</note> they reckoned that now Hereſy would be extirpated, and that the King was as much engaged againſt it, as he was when he writ againſt <hi>Luther:</hi> this made the Suppreſſion of the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries paſs much the eaſier. The poor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers were now expoſed to the Rage of their Enemies, and had no Comfort from any part of it, but one, that they were not delivered up to the Cruelty of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Courts, or the Trials <hi>ex Officio,</hi> but were to be tried by Juries: yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the benefit of Abjuration, was a Severity without a Precedent, and was a forcing Martyrdom on them, ſince they were not to be the better for their Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. It was ſome Satisfaction to the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clergy, that the incontinent Prieſts were to be ſo ſeverely puniſhed; which <hi>Cromwell</hi> put in, and the Clergy knew not how they could decently oppoſe it. Upon the paſſing the Act, the <hi>German</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170737:127"/>being ſet on to it by thoſe that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured their Doctrine in <hi>England,</hi> deſired an Audience of the King, and told him of the Grief with which their Maſters would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the News of this Act; and therefore earneſtly preſs'd him to ſtop the Execution of it. The King anſwered that he found it neceſſary to have the Act made, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Inſolence of ſome People, but aſſured them it ſhould not be put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, except upon great Provocation. When the Princes heard of the Act, they writ to the King to the ſame purpoſe: they warned him of many Biſhops that were about him, who in their Hearts lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Popery, and all the old Abuſes; and took this method to force the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back to the former Yoke, hoping that if they once made him cruel to all thoſe they called Hereticks, it would be eaſy to bring him back to ſubmit to that Tyranny, which he had ſhaken off; and therefore they propoſed a Conference between ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of both ſides in order to an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Doctrine. The King was only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned upon State Maxims, to keep up their League in Oppoſition to the Emperour; but they ſtill preſs'd a Religious as well as a Civil League.</p>
               <p>After the Act of the ſix Articles,
<note place="margin">An Act for ſuppreſſing the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.</note> the Act for ſuppreſſing the Monaſteries was brought in; and tho there were ſo many Abbots ſitting in the Houſe, none of them proteſted againſt it; <q rend="inline">By it no Monaſtery was ſuppreſſed, but only the Reſignations
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170737:127"/>made or to be made, were confirmed; and the King's Right, founded either on their Surrenders, Forfeitures, or Attainders of Treaſon, was declared good in Law. Houſes ſurrendred were to be managed by the Court of Augmentations; but thoſe ſeized on by Attainders were to come to the Exchequer. All Perſons except the Founders and Donors were to have the ſame Rights to the Lands, belonging to theſe Houſes, that they had before this Act was made. All Deeds and Leaſes made for a Year before this, to the prejudice of theſe Houſes were annulled; and all the Churches belonging to them, and former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exempted, were put under the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Biſhop, or of ſuch as ſhould be appointed by the King.</q> This laſt <hi>Proviſo</hi> has produced a great Miſchief in this Church; for many that purchaſed Abby-Lands, had this Clauſe put in their Grants, that they ſhould be the Viſitors of the Churches, and by this they continue ſtill exempted from the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Juriſdiction; and this has em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened many to break out into great Scandals, which have been made uſe of by prejudiced Men to caſt an Obloquy on the Church; tho this Diſorder proceeds only from the want of Authority in the Biſhops to cenſure them. A Queſtion was raiſed upon this Suppreſſion, whether the Lands ſhould have reverted to the Donors, or been eſcheated to the Crown. By a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate in <hi>Theodoſius</hi>'s
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170737:128"/>time, all the Endowments of the Heatheniſh Temples were given to the <hi>Fiſc,</hi> and tho the Heirs of the <hi>Donors</hi> pretended to them, yet it was ſaid, that by the Gifts that their Anceſtors made, they were totally alienated from them and their Heirs. When the Order of the Templers was ſuppreſſed, their Lands went to the Lord by an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat. This might ſeem reaſonable in Endowments that were ſimple Gifts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Conditions: But the Grants to Religious Houſes were of the nature of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, given in conſideration of the Maſſes, that were to be ſaid for them and their Families; and therefore it was inferred, that when the Cheat of redeeming Souls out of Purgatory was diſcovered, and theſe Houſes were ſuppreſs'd, then the Lands ought to revert to the Heirs of the <hi>Donors;</hi> and upon that account it was thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to exclude them by a ſpecial <hi>Proviſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Bill was brought in,
<note place="margin">An Act for new Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks.</note> empower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King to erect new Biſhopricks by his Letters Patents; it was read three times in one day in the Houſe of Lords. <q rend="inline">The Preamble ſet forth that the ill Lives of thoſe that were called Religious, made it neceſſary to change thir Houſes to better Uſes, for teaching the Word of God, inſtructing of Children, educating of Clerks, relieving of old infirm People, the endowing of Readers for Greek, Latine, and Hebrew, mending of High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and the bettering the Condition of the Pariſh Prieſts; and for this end the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170737:128"/>King was empowered to erect new Sees, and to aſſign what Limits and Diviſions, and appoint them what Statutes he pleaſed.</q> I have ſeen the firſt Draught of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble all written with the King's own Hand; and indeed he uſed extraordinary Care in corecting both Acts of Parliament and Proclamations with his own Hand: All Papers in matters of Religion, that were ſet out by publick Authority in this Reign, were reviſed by him, and in many places large Corrections are to be ſeen, made with his own Hand, which ſhew both his great Judgment in thoſe Matters, and his extraordinary Application to Buſineſs; but as he was fond of his two accquired Titles, of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Head of the Church;</hi> and loved to ſhew that he did not carry them in vain; ſo there was nothing which he affected more, then to diſcover his Learning and Underſtanding in matters of Religion. He writ alſo a Liſt of all the new Sees which he intended to found, which were <hi>Waltham,</hi> for <hi>Eſſex,</hi> St. <hi>Albans,</hi> for <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> another for <hi>Bedfordſhire</hi> and <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire</hi> out of the Monaſteries of <hi>Dunſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Newenham,</hi> and <hi>Clowſtown;</hi> another for <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> out of the Rents of <hi>Oſney,</hi> and <hi>Tame,</hi> one for <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton</hi> and <hi>Huntington,</hi> out of <hi>Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> one for <hi>Midleſex</hi> out of <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> one for <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Rutland,</hi> out of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter;</hi> one for <hi>Gloceſterſhire</hi> out of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> in <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> one for <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> out

The King had formed a great Deſign of endowing many Sees, and making many other noble Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; yet the great Change that was made in the Councils and Miniſtry before this took Effect, made that only a ſmall part of that, which he now intended, was accompliſhed.
<note place="margin">An Act for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Another Act was brought in, concerning the Obedience due to the King's Proclamations, which ſet forth, <q rend="inline">That great Exceptions had been made to the Legality of the King's Proclamations, by ſome who did not conſider what a King might do by his Royal Power; which the King took very ill; and ſince many Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions called for ſpeedy Remedies, and could not admit of Delays till a Parliament might be called; therefore it was enacted, that ſuch Proclamations as the King ſet
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170737:129"/>out by Advice of his Council, with Pains upon Offenders, ſhould be obeyed as if they were Acts of Parliaments; yet it was provided that no Laws nor Cuſtoms might be taken away by them, and that the Subjects ſhould not ſuffer in their Eſtates, Liberties, or Perſons, by them. If any offended againſt them, and fled out of the Kingdom, that was made <hi>Treaſon.</hi> It was alſo provided that if the King's Heirs ſhould reign before they were of Age, the Proclamations ſet out by the Privy Council, ſhould have the like force in Law.</q> By this the Injunctions that had been given, or ſhould be thereafter given, were now legally authorized. The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Precedence paſt in this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The King's <hi>Vicegerent</hi> was to take place of all after the Royal Family, and next him among the Clergy, came the two Arch-biſhops, then the Biſhops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Dureſme,</hi> after them the Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> as Prelate of the Garter, and all the other Biſhops were to take place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Date of their Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>A Bill of Attainder paſt,
<note place="margin">Some at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted without being heard.</note> not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Sentences that had been given againſt the Marqueſs of <hi>Exeter,</hi> the Lord <hi>Mounticute,</hi> and others, that had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned at common Law; but of ſome that were of new attainted without a Trial: of theſe ſome were abſent, and others were in Priſon; but it was not thought fit to bring them to make their Anſwers: The
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170737:130"/>chief of theſe were the Marchionſes of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and the Counteſs of <hi>Sarum</hi> (Mother to Cardinal <hi>Pool:</hi>) It was queſtioned whether this could be done in Law or not. The Judges delivered their Opinion, that it was againſt natural Juſtice to condemn any without hearing them; and that when the Parliament proceeded as a Court, they were obliged to follow the common Rules of Equity; but if they did otherwiſe, yet ſince they were the Supream Court of the Nation, whatſoever they did, could not be reverſed. The latter part of this was laid hold on, and the former was neglected, ſo that Act paſt. This Council was aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and he being the firſt that was executed upon ſuch a Sentence, gave occaſion to many to obſerve the Juſtice of God, in making ill Councils turn upon thoſe that gave them.</p>
               <p>When the Parliament was prorogued,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The King's Kindneſss to</hi> Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> the King ordered <hi>Cranmer</hi> to put in writing all the Arguments he had uſed againſt the ſix Articles, and bring them to him. He ſent alſo both <hi>Cromwell</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> to dine with him, and to aſſure him of the Conſtancy of his Kindneſs to him. At Table they expreſſed great Eſteem for him, and acknowledged that he had oppoſed the ſix Articles with ſo much Learning and Gravity, that thoſe who differed moſt from him, could not but value him highly for it; and that he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to fear any thing from the King: <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſaid the King made that difference
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170737:130"/>between him and the reſt of his Council, that he would not ſo much as hearken to any Complaints that were made of him; and made a Parallel between him and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Wolſey;</hi> the one loſt his Friends by his Pride, and the other gained on his Enemies, by his Humility and Mildneſs: the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> ſaid he could ſpeak beſt of the Cardinal, having been his <hi>Man</hi> ſo long: this heated <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he never liked his Manners, and tho <hi>Wolſey</hi> had intended if he had been cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Pope, to have carried him with him to <hi>Italy;</hi> yet he was reſolved not to have gone, tho he knew the Duke intended to have gone with him. Upon this the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> ſwore he lied, and gave him foul Language. This put all the Company in great Diſorder: They were in ſome ſort reconciled, but were never hearty Friends after this. <hi>Cranmer</hi> put his Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſix Articles together, and gave them to his Secretary to be written out in a fair Hand for the King's uſe: but he croſſing the <hi>Thames</hi> with the Book in his Boſom, met with ſuch an Adventure on the Water as might have at another time ſent the Author to the Fire. There was a Bear baited near the River, which break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looſe, run into it, and happened to overturn the Boat in which <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary was, and he being in danger of his Life, took no care of the Book, which falling from him floated on the River, and was taken up by the Bear-Ward, and put
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170737:131"/>in the hand of a Prieſt that ſtood by, to ſee what it might contain; he preſently found it was a Confutation of the ſix Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and ſo told the Bear-ward that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it would certainly be hanged. So when the Secretary came to ask for it, and ſaid it was the Arch-biſhop's Book; the other that was an obſtinate Papiſt, refuſed to give it, and reckoned that now <hi>Cranmer</hi> would be certainly ruined: but the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary acquainting <hi>Cromwell</hi> with it, he called for him next day, and chid him ſeverely for preſuming to keep a Privy-Counſellours Book, and ſo he took it out of his Hands: thus <hi>Cranmer</hi> was delivered out of this Danger. <hi>Shaxton</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi> not only reſigned their Biſhopricks, but being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented for ſome Words ſpoken againſt the ſix Articles, they were put in Priſon, where they lay till a recantation diſcharged the one, and the King's Death ſet the other at liberty. There were about 500 others preſented on the ſame account, but upon the Interceſſions of <hi>Cranmer, Cromwell,</hi> and others, they were ſet at liberty, and there was a ſtop put to the further Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Act till <hi>Cromwell</hi> fell.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops of the Popiſh Party took ſtrange Methods to inſinuate themſelves into the King's Confidence,
<note place="margin">Biſhops hold their Sees at the King's Pleaſure.</note> for they took out Commiſſions by which they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, <q rend="inline">That all Juriſdiction, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, flowed from the King, and that they exerciſed it only at the King's Courteſy: and as they had of his Bounty,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170737:131"/>ſo they would be ready to deliver it up when he ſhould be pleaſed to call for it; and therefore the King did empower them in his ſtead, to ordain, give Inſtitution, and do all the other parts of the Epiſcopal Function, which was to laſt during his Pleaſure: and a mighty charge was given them to ordain none but Perſons of great Integrity, good Life, and well learned; for ſince the Corruption of Religion flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ill Paſtors, ſo the Reformation of it was to be expected chiefly from good Paſtors.</q> By this they were made indeed the King's Biſhops: in this <hi>Bonner</hi> ſet an Example to the reſt, but it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that <hi>Cranmer</hi> took out any ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion all this Reign.</p>
               <p>Now came on the total Diſſolution of the Abbies,
<note place="margin">All the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt.</note> 57 ſurrenders were made this Year, of which 30 are yet extant; of theſe, 37 were Monaſteries, and 20 were Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries; and among them 12 were Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Abbies; which were in all 28, <hi>Abington,</hi> St. <hi>Albans,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin's Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Battell,</hi> St. <hi>Bennets</hi> in the Holm, <hi>Bardeny, Cirenceſter, Colcheſter, Coventry, Croyland,</hi> St. <hi>Edmundsbury, Eveſham, Glaſſenbury, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſte, Hide, Malmsbury,</hi> St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s in <hi>York, Peterborough, Ramſey, Reading, Selby, Shrewsbury, Taveſtock, Tewkesbury, Thorney, Waltham, Weſtminſter,</hi> and <hi>Winchelcomb.</hi> When all had thus reſigned, Commiſſioners were appointed by the Court of Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to ſeize on the Revenues and Goods belonging to theſe Houſes, to eſtabliſh the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170737:132"/>Penſions that were to be given to every one that had been in them, and to pull down the Churches, or ſuch other parts of the Fabrick, as they thought ſuperfluous, and to ſell the Materials of them. When this was done, others began to get Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals to be ſurrendred to the King; <hi>Thirleby</hi> being Maſter of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Hoſpital in <hi>Southwark,</hi> was the firſt that ſet an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the reſt; he was ſoon after made a Biſhop, and turned with every Change that followed, till Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Crown, and then he refuſed to comply tho he had gone along with all the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that were made in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time. The valued Rents of the Abby-Lands as they were then let, was 132607 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> but they were worth above ten times ſo much in true value. The King had now in his hand the greateſt Advantage that ever King of <hi>England</hi> had, both for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching the Crown, and making Royal Foundations. But ſuch was his Eaſineſs to his Courtiers, and his Laviſhneſs, that all this melted away in a few Years, and his Deſigns were never accompliſhed; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have founded 18 new Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, but he founded only ſix: Other great Projects did alſo become abortive. In particular one that was deſigned by Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> which was a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for States-men: he propoſed the crecting a Houſe for Perſons of Quality, or of extraordinary Endowments, for the ſtudy of the Civil Law, and of the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170737:132"/>Latine and French Tongues; of whom, ſome were to be ſent with every Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour beyond Sea, to be improved in the Knowledg of Forreign Aſſairs, in which they ſhould be imploied as they grew capable of them: And others were to be ſet to work to write the Hiſtory of the Traſactions abroad, and of Aſſairs at home. This was to ſupply one Loſs that was like to follow on the Fall of Abbies; for in moſt of them there was kept a Chronicle of the Times. Theſe were written by Men that were more credulous than judicious; and ſo they are often more particular in the recital of Trifles, than of important Affairs, and an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Humour of lying, when it might raiſe the Credit of their Order or Houſe, runs through all their Manuſcripts. All the Ground that <hi>Cranmer</hi> gained this Year, in which there was ſo much loſt, was a Liberty that all private Perſons might have Bibles in their Houſe, the managing of which was put in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Hands, by a ſpecial Patent: <hi>Gardiner</hi> oppoſed it vehemently, and built much on this, that without Tradition it was impoſſible to underſtand the meaning of the Scriptures; and one day before the King, he challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Cranmer</hi> to ſhew any Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Scriptures and the Apoſtles Canons. It is not known how <hi>Cranmer</hi> managed the Debate, but the Iſſue of it was this, The King judged in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and ſaid, He was an old experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170737:133"/>Captain, and ought not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by freſh Men and Novices. The King was now reſolved to marry again, and both the Emperour and the King of <hi>France</hi> propoſed Matches to him, but they came to no Effect. The Emperour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by all means poſſible to ſeparate the King from the Princes of the <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caldick</hi> League; and the Act of the ſix Articles had done that already in a great meaſure; for they complained much of the King's Severity in thoſe Points, which were the principal Parts of their Doctrine; ſuch as Communion in both kinds, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Maſſes, and the Marriage of the Clergy. <hi>Gardiner</hi> ſtudied to animate the King much againſt them; he often told him, it was below his Dignity to ſuffer dull <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> did not look on the Emperour as their Soveraign, but only as the <hi>Head</hi> of the Empire; and they did believe that every Prinee in his Dominions, and the Diet for the whole Empire, had ſufficient Authority for making Laws in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs; but what other Conſiderations could not induce the King to, was like to be more powerfully carried on by the Match with <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> which was now ſet on foot.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:170737:133"/>
               <p>There had been a Treaty between her Father and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> for the Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and her; but it had gone no farther then a Contract between the Fathers. <hi>Hans Holbin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>A Treaty for a Match with</hi> Ann <hi>of</hi> Cleve.</note> the Famous Painter of that Age, took her Picture very much to her Advantage; for the King never liked the Original ſo well as he had done the Picture. The Duke of <hi>Saxe</hi> diſwaded the Match, becauſe the King was going backward in the matter of the Reformation: but <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſet it on vigorouſly. It was ſaid, the Lady had great Charms in her Perſon; but ſhe could ſpeak no Language but Dutch, which the King underſtood not; nor was ſhe bred to Muſick: And ſhe had a ſtifneſs in her Breeding, which was not at all accommodated to the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. The Match was at laſt agreed on; and in the end of <hi>December</hi> ſhe was brought over. The King was impatient, and ſo went <hi>incognito</hi> to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> but was ſtruck when he ſaw her. There was a Rudeneſs in her, which did not at all pleaſe him: He ſwore they had brought over a <hi>Flanders Mare</hi> to him; and took up an incurable Averſion to her. He reſolved to break the Match if it were poſſible; but his Affairs made the Friendſhip of the <hi>German</hi> Princes, to be then very neceſſary to him; ſo that he did not think it adviſable to put any Affront on the Dukes of <hi>Saxe</hi> and <hi>Cleve,</hi> her Brother, and her Brother in Law. The Emperour had at this time made a haſty Journey through <hi>France;</hi> and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170737:134"/>
                  <hi>Francis</hi> and he had an Interview, where as the King was informed a Project was laid down againſt him,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1540"/> which was chiefly ſet on by the Pope. <hi>Francis</hi> was thinking how to take <hi>Calais,</hi> and the other places the King had in <hi>France,</hi> from him; it had been alſo eaſy for him to have engaged the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt him: And the People in the North were thought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their former Diſpoſition, to riſe ſtill; ſo that a War made on the King in ſuch Circumſtances, was like to find him at a great Diſadvantage. This made the King more tender of offending the <hi>Germans.</hi> But he tried if that Precontract with the Duke of <hi>Lorrains</hi>'s Son, could furniſh him with a fair Excuſe to break the Match. The King expreſſed the great Trouble he was in, both to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and many of his other Servants; and one of them pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told him, that Subjects had this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over Princes, that they choſe Wives for themſelves, whereas Princes were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to take ſuch as were brought them. But nothing could be built on that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contract, which was only an Agreement between the Fathers, their Children being under Age; and that was afterwards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled and broken by the Parents. So <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and <hi>Tonſtall</hi> beiug required to give their Opinions as Divines, ſaid, there was nothing in it to hinder the King's Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Lady.
<note place="margin">The King marries her, but never liked her.</note>
               </p>
               <p>On the the 6th of <hi>January</hi> the King Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her; but expreſſed his diſlike of her
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170737:134"/>ſo viſibly, that all about him took notice of it: And the day after that he told <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> that he had not conſummated his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1540"/> and he believed he ſhould never do it: He ſuſpected ſhe was not a Virgin; and ſhe had ill Smells about her; ſo that his Averſion to her was encreaſed to ſuch a Degree, that he believed he ſhould never be able to change it. <hi>Cromwell</hi> did what he could to overcome theſe Inclinations; but that was not to be done: And tho the King lived five Months with her, and lay often in the Bed with her, yet his Averſion to her rather encreaſed than abated. She ſeemed little concerned at it, and expreſſed a great readineſs to concur in every thing, that might diſengage him from a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage that was ſo unacceptable to him. Inſtruments were brought over, to ſhew that the Contract between her and the Prince of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> was void: But they took ſome Advantage, becauſe it was not declared whether the Contract was in the Words of the Preſent, or of the Future Tenſe.</p>
               <p>In <hi>April</hi> there was a Seſſion of Parliament,
<note place="margin">A New Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and at the opening of it, as the Lord Chancellour declared the matters relating to the State, for which the King had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them: So the Vicegerent ſpake to them concerning the matters of Religion: He told them there was nothing which the King deſired ſo much as an entire Union among all his Subjects; but ſome Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries oppoſed it as much as he promoted
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170737:135"/>it; and between the raſhneſs on the one hand, and Inveterare Superſtition on the other,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1540"/> great Diſſentions had ariſen. Theſe were inflamed by the reproachful names of <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Heretick:</hi> And tho they had now the Word of God in all their hands, yet they ſtudied rather to juſtify their Paſſions out of it, than to govern their Lives by it. In order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving this, the King reſolved to ſet forth an Expoſition of the Doctrine of Chriſt, without any corrupt Mixtures; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch Ceremonies as might be of good uſe; and that being done, he was reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to puniſh all Tranſgreſſours, of what ſide ſoever they might be: For that end, he had appointed the two Archbiſhops and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>London, Dureſm, Wincheſter, Rocheſter, Hereford,</hi> and St. <hi>Davids;</hi> and 11 Divines, <hi>Thirleby, Robertſon, Cox, Day, Oglethorp, Redmayn, Edgeworth, Crayford, Symons, Robins,</hi> and <hi>Treſham,</hi> for ſetling the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And the Biſhops of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Walls, Ely, Sarum, Chicheſter, Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Landaff,</hi> for the Ceremonies. Theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees for Religion, ſat as often as the Affairs of the Parliament could allow of. Two days after the Parliament met, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> was made Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which ſhews it was not the King's Diſlike of the Queen that wrought his Ruine, otherwiſe he had not now raiſed his Title.

                     <hi>The Knights of St.</hi> John <hi>ſuppreſſed.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A Bill was brought in to the Parliament for ſuppreſſing the Knights of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Theſe were at firſt only an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170737:135"/>for entertaining the Pilgrims that went to viſit the Holy Grave: And after that, they became an Order of Knights; and they and the Knights-Templars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted and guarded the Pilgrims. It was thought for ſome Ages, one of the higheſt Expreſſion of Devotion to Chriſt, to go and viſit the places where he was crucified, buried, and aſcended to Heaven: And it was look'd on as highly Meritorious, to go and fight for recovering the Holy-Land, out of the hands of Infidels; ſo that almoſt every one that died, either vowed to go to the Holy War, or left ſomewhat to ſuch as ſhould go. If they recovered, they bought off their Vow, by giving ſome Lands for the Entertainment of thoſe Knights. There were great Complaints made of the Templars; but whether it was their Wealth that made them a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable Prey, or their Guilt that drew Ruine on them, is not certain. They were condemned in a Council, and all of them that could be found, were cruelly put to Death. But the other Order was ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; and being beaten out of <hi>Judea,</hi> they ſetled at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> out of which they were late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driven; and were now ſetled in <hi>Malta.</hi> They were under a great Maſter, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the Pope and the Emperour. But ſome they could not be brought to ſurrender of their own accord, as others had done; it was neceſſary to ſuppreſs them by Act of Parliament. Another Houſe which they had in <hi>Ireland</hi> was alſo ſuppreſſed,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170737:136"/>and Penſions were reſerved for the Priors and Knights. On the 14th of <hi>May,</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was Prorogued to the 25th; a Vote having paſt, that the Bills ſhould continue in the State they were in.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Cromwel's <hi>Fall.</hi>
                  </note> there was a ſudden turn at Court, for the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> arreſted <hi>Cromwel</hi> of High Treaſon, and ſent him Priſoner to the Tower. He had many Enemies: The meanneſs of his Birth made the Nobility take it ill, to ſee the Son of a Black-Smith made an Earl, and have the Garter given him; beſides his being Lord Privy Seal, Lord Chamberlain of <hi>England,</hi> Lord Vicegerent; and a little while before, he had alſo the Maſterſhip of the Rolls. All the Popiſh Clergy hated him violently: They imputed the Suppreſſion of Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the Injunctions that were laid on them, chiefly to his Counſels: And it was thought that it was mainly by his means that the King and the Emperour continued to be in ſuch ill Terms. The King did now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that there was no agreement like to be made between the Emperour and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> for it ſtuck at the matter of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan;</hi> in which neither of them would yield to the other; and the King was ſure, they would both court his Friendſhip in caſe of a War; and this made him leſs concerned for the Favour of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Princes. So, now <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Counſels became unacceptable: With this a ſecret Reaſon concurred. The King did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hate the Queen, but was now come to be
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170737:136"/>in Love with <hi>Katherine Howard,</hi> Neece to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> which both raiſed his Intereſt, and depreſt <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who had made the former Match. The King was alſo willing to caſt upon him all the Errours that had been committed of late, and by making him a Sacrifice, he hoped he ſhould regain the Affections of his People. The King had alſo Informations brought him, That he ſecretly encouraged thoſe that oppoſed the ſix Articles, and diſcouraged thoſe who went about the Execution of it. His Fall came ſo ſuddenly, that he had not the leaſt Apprehenſion of it before the Storm brake on him. He had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fate of all diſgraced Miniſters; his Friends forſook him, and his Enemies inſulted over him; only <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſtuck to him; and wrote earneſtly to the King in his Favours. <q rend="inline">He ſaid he found that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways loved the King above all things; and had ſerved him with ſuch Fidelity and Succeſs, that he believed no King of <hi>England</hi> had ever a faithfuller Servant: And he wiſhed the King might find ſuch a Councellour, who both could, and would, ſerve him as he had done.</q> So great and generous a Soul had <hi>Cranmer,</hi> that was not turned by changes in his Friends Fortunes; and would venture on the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of ſo Imperious a Prince, rather than fail in the Duties of Friendſhip.

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170737:137"/>for themſelves, which he had promoted too much before, was now turned upon himſelf. He had ſuch Enemies in the Houſe of Lords, that the Bill of Attainder was diſpatched in two days, being read twice in one day. <hi>Cranmer</hi> was abſent, and no other would venture to ſpeak for him. But he met with more Juſtice in the Houſe of Commons; for it ſtuck ten days there. And in Concluſion, a new Bill was drawn againſt him, and ſent up to the Lords, to which they conſented; and it had the Royal Aſſent.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">In it they ſet forth,

He had likewiſe been found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of great Oppreſſion and Bribery: And when he heard, that ſome Lords were tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Counſel againſt him, he had threatned, that he would raiſe great ſtirrs in <hi>England:</hi> For theſe things, he was Attainted both of High Treaſon and Hereſy.</q> A Proviſo was added, for ſecuring the Church of <hi>Wells,</hi> of which he had been Dean.</p>
               <p>This was lookt on as very hard Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. It was believed,
<note place="margin">Cenſures paſt upon it.</note> That he had at leaſt Verbal Orders from the King, for the Licences and Orders that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of; and perhaps he could have ſhewed ſome in Writing, if he had been heard to make his Anſwers. Bribery ſeemed to be caſt on him, only to render him odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but no Particulars were mentioned. Nor was it credible, That he could have ſpoken ſuch Words of the King, as were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, eſpecially when he was in the height of his Favour; and if he had ſpoken them above a Year before, it is not to be imagined that they could have been ſo long
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170737:138"/>kept ſecret; and what was ſaid of his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a Dagger, look'd like a deſign to affix an overt Act to them.</p>
               <p>This being done,
<note place="margin">The King's Marriage annulled.</note> The King went on to move for a Divorce. An Addreſs was moved to be made to him by the Lords, that he would ſuffer his Marriage to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. <hi>Cranmer</hi> and others were ſent down to deſire the Concurrence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and they ordered 20 of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to go along with the Lords, who went all in a body to the King. He granted their deſire, the matter being concerted before. So a Commiſſion was ſent to the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to diſcuſs it: <hi>Gardiner</hi> opened it to them; and they appointed a Committee for the Examination of Witneſſes. The Subſtance of the whole Evidence amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to theſe Particulars; That the matter of the Precontract with the Prince of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> was not fully cleared; and it did not appear, if it was made by the Queen; or whether it was in the Words of the preſent time, or not. That the King had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her againſt her Will; and had not given an inward and compleat Conſent; and that he had never conſummated the Marriage; ſo that they ſaw he could have no Iſſue by the Queen. Upon theſe grounds the whole Convocation with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent annulled the Marriage, and declared both Parties free. This was the groſſeſt piece of Compliance that the King had from his Clergy in his whole Reign: For as they knew that there was nothing in the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170737:138"/>pretended Precontract; ſo by voiding the Marriage, becauſe the Conſent was not internal and free, they made a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Precedent for breaking all publick Treaties; for none can know Men's Hearts; it would be eaſy for every one to pretend that he had not given a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Conſent; and that being allowed, there could be no Confidence nor ſafety among Men any more. And in the Proceſs for the King's firſt Divorce, they had laid it down as a Principle, that a Marriage was compleat, tho it were never conſummated. But in a Word, the King was reſolved to be rid of the Queen; and the Clergy were reſolved not to offend him: And they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſought out Reaſons to give a colour to their Sentence, then paſt it on the force of thoſe Reaſons. <hi>Cromwel</hi> was required to ſend a Declaration of all he knew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Marriage, which he did; but ended in theſe moſt abject Words, <q rend="inline">Written with the heavy Heart, and trembling Hand, of your Highneſs's moſt heavy, and moſt miſerable Priſoner, and poor Slave, <hi>Tho. Cromwel:</hi> and under his Subſcription he wrote, Moſt Sacred Prince, I cry for, <hi>Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.</hi>
                  </q> The Judgment of the Convocation was reported to the Houſe of Lords by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were opened by <hi>Gardiner.</hi> They were ſent down to the Commons to give them the ſame account; and both Houſes were ſatisfied with it. Next day, ſome Lords were ſent to the Queen, who had retired
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170737:139"/>to <hi>Richmond:</hi> They told her, The King was reſolved to declare her his adopted Siſter, and to ſetle 4000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year on her, if ſhe would conſent to it; which ſhe cheerfully embraced; and it being left to her choice, either to live in <hi>England,</hi> or to return to her Brother; She preferred the former. They preſt her to write to her Brother, that all this matter was done with her good Will; that the King uſed her, as a Father; and that therefore he, and the other Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, ſhould not take this ill at his hands. She was a little averſe to this, but was prevailed on to do it. When things were thus prepared, the Act confirming the Judgment of the Convocation, paſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Oppoſition. An Act paſt, miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating one Clauſe in the Act of the ſix Articles; by which, the pains of Death for the Marriage or Incontinence of the Clergy, were changed into a Forfeiture of their Goods and Benefices. Another Act paſt, Authorizing thoſe Committees of Biſhops and Divines that had been named by the King, both for the Doctrine and Ceremonies, to go on in it; and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that what ſhould be agreed on by them, and Publiſhed with the King's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, ſhould bind the Subjects as much as if every Particular in it had been ennumerated in that Act, any Law or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome to the contrary notwithſtanding: But a Proviſo was added, That nothing might be done by them contrary to the Laws then in force: Which Contradiction
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170737:139"/>in the Proviſos, ſeems to have been put in on deſign, to keep all Eccleſiaſtical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings under the Inſpection of the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Courts, ſince they are the only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders of Acts of Parliament. Another Act paſt, That no Pretence of a Precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſhould be made uſe of to annul a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage duly Solemnized and Conſummated: And that no Degrees of Kindred, but thoſe ennumerated in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> might hinder a Marriage. This laſt was added, To enable the King to marry <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine Howard,</hi> that was Couſin German to <hi>Ann Boleyn,</hi> which was one of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees prohibited by the Canon Law; but the reaſon of the former part is not known. It directly condemns the King's Divorce of <hi>Ann Boleyn,</hi> grounded on a pretended Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contract.</p>
               <p>The Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> gave the King a Subſidy of 4 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound, to be payed in two Years, with a Preamble of high Acknowledgments of their Happineſs under his Protection. A Subſidy was alſo asked of the Laity, but in the Houſe of Commons it was much oppoſed: Many ſaid they had given the King the Abbey-Lands, in hopes that no Subſidies ſhould have been any more demanded; and it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſtrange Profuſeneſs, that now within a Year after that, a Subſidy was demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But it was anſwered, That the King had been at great charge in fortifying his Coaſts; and in keeping up ſuch Leagues beyond Sea, as preſerved the Nation in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170737:140"/>ſafety; a Tenth and four 15ths were granted. Several Bills of Attainder were paſt. And in Concluſion, the King ſent a General Pardon, out of which, <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and divers others were excepted; and then the Parliament was diſſolved. <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s mean Addreſſes could not preſerve him: So he was executed on the 28 of <hi>July:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cromwels <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </note> He thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God for bringing him to die in that manner, which was juſt, on the account of his <q rend="inline">Sins againſt God, and his Offences againſt his Prince. He declared that he doubted of no Article of the Catholick Faith, nor of any Sacrament of the Church. He ſaid, He had been ſeduced, but now he died in the Catholick Faith; and denied he had ſupported the Preachers of ill Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</q> He deſired all their Prayers; and prayed very fervently for himſelf; and thus did he end his days.</p>
               <p>He roſe meerly by the ſtrength of his Natural Parts; for his Education was ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his mean Extraction: Only he had all the New Teſtament in Latin, by Heart. He carried his Greatneſs with Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Moderation; and fell rather under the weight of Popular <hi>Odium,</hi> than Guilt. At his Death he mixed none of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with his Devotions: So it was ſaid, that he uſed the Word, <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> in its true ſenſe, and in Oppoſition to the Novelties of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Yet his Ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way of expreſſing himſelf, made the Papiſts ſay, that he died repenting of his
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170737:140"/>Hereſy: But the Proteſtants ſaid that he died in the ſame Perſwaſions in which he lived. With him fell the Office of the King's <hi>Vicegerent,</hi> and none after him have aſpired to that Character, that proved ſo fatal to him who firſt carried it. It was believed that the King lamented his Death when it was too late; and the Miſeries that fell on the new Queen, and on the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and his Family, were look'd on as Strokes from Heaven on them, for their cruel proſecuting this unfortunate Miniſter. With his Fall, the Progreſs of the Reformation ſtopt; for <hi>Cranmer</hi> could never gain much Ground after this, and indeed many hoped that he ſhould be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent after <hi>Cromwell;</hi> ſome complained of him in the Houſe of Commons, and Informations were brought the King, that the chief Encouragement that the Hereticks had, came from him.</p>
               <p>The Eccleſiaſtical Committees imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King,
<note place="margin">A Book of Religion ſet out by Biſhops.</note> were now at work, and gave the laſt finiſhing to a Book formerly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, but at this time corrected and explained in many Particulars. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with the Explanation of <hi>Faith,</hi> which according to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was thought an implicit believing whatever the Church propoſed: But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers made it the chief Subject of their Books and Sermons, to perſwade People to believe in Chriſt, and not in the Church; and made great uſe of thoſe Places in which it was ſaid, <hi>That Chriſtians are juſtified
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170737:141"/>by Faith only:</hi> tho ſome explained this in ſuch a manner, that it gave their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries Advantages to charge them that they denied the neceſſity of Good Works; but they all taught that tho they were not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Juſtification, yet they were neceſſary to Salvation. They differed alſo in their Notion of Good Works: The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> taught, that the Honour done to God in his Images, or to the Saints in their Shrines and Relicks, or to the Prieſts, were the beſt ſort of Good Works: Whereas the Reformers preſt Juſtice and Mercy moſt, and diſcovered the Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other. The Opinion of the Merit of Good Works, was alſo ſo highly raiſed, that many thought they purchaſed Heaven by them. This the Reformers did alſo correct, and taught the People to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend meerly upon the Death and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Chriſt. Others moved ſubtiller Queſtions, As whether Obedience was an eſſential part of Faith, or only a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of it? This was a Nicety ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Divines, that built only on the Simplicity of the Scriptures, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Subtilties of the Schools; and it was ſaid, that Men of ill Lives abuſed this Doctrine, and thought that if they could but aſſure themſelves that Chriſt died for them, they were ſafe enough.</p>
               <p>So now when they ſettled the Notion of <hi>Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of Faith.</note> they divided it into two ſorts: The one was a Perſwaſion of the Truth of the Goſpel; but the other carried with
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170737:141"/>it a Submiſſion to the Will of God; and both Hope, Love, and Obedience belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to it; which was the Faith profeſſed in Baptiſm, and ſo much extoll'd by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> It was not to be ſo underſtood as if it were a Certainty of our being predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, which may be only a Preſumption; ſince all God's Promiſes are made to us on Conditions; but it was an entire receiving the whole Goſpel according to our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Vows. <hi>Cranmer</hi> took great Pains to ſtate this matter right; and made a large Collection of many places, all writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his own Hand, both out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and Modern Authors, concerning Faith, Juſtification and the Merit of Good Works; and concluded with this, That our Juſtification was to be aſcribed only to the Merits of Chriſt; and that thoſe who are juſtified muſt have Charity as well as Faith, but that neither of theſe was the meritorious Cauſe of Juſtification. After this was ſtated, they made next a large and full Explanation of the Apoſtles Creed with great Judgment, and many excellent practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inferences; the Definition they gave of the Catholick Church runs thus: <q rend="inline">It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all Aſſemblies of Men in the whole World that received the Faith of Chriſt, who ought to hold an Unity of Love and Brotherly Agreement together, by which they became Members of the Catholick Church:</q> After this they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the ſeven Sacraments.</p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:170737:142"/>
               <p>In opening theſe there were great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; for, as was formerly mentioned, the method uſed, was to open the Point enquired into by propoſing many Queries,
<note place="margin">And of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menss.</note> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one was to give in his Anſwer to theſe, with the Reaſons of it; and then others were appointed to make an Abſtract of thoſe things, in which they all either agreed or differed. The Original Papers relating to theſe Points are yet preſerved, which ſhew with how great Conſideration they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Changes that were then made. <hi>Cranmer</hi> had at this time ſome particular Opinions concerning Eccleſiaſtical Offices; That they were delivered from the King, as other Civil Offices were, and that Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not indiſpenſibly neceſſary, and was only a Ceremony, that might be uſed or laid aſide; but that the Authority was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to Church-men only by the King's Commiſſion; yet he delivered his Opinion in this matter with great Modeſty, and he not only ſubſcribed the Book in which the contrary Doctrine was eſtabliſhed, but afterwards publiſhed it in a Book which he writ in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days, from whence it appears that he changed his Mind in this Particular. Baptiſm was explained as had been done formerly; Penance was made to conſiſt in the Abſolution of the Prieſts which had been formerly declared only to be deſirable, where it could be had. In the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, both Tranſubſtantiation, Private Maſſes, and Communion in one kind, were aſſerted: They aſſerted the Obligation of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170737:142"/>the Levitical Law about the Degrees of Marriage, and the Indiſſolubleneſs of that Bond. They ſet out the Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prieſts and Deacons; and that no Biſhop had Authority over another: they made a long Excurſion againſt the Pope's Pretenſions, and for juſtifying the King's Supremacy. They ſaid, Confirmation was inſtituted by the Apoſtles, and was profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but not neceſſary to Salvation: and they aſſerted extream Unction to have been commanded by the Apoſtles, for the Health both of Soul and Body. Then were the Ten Commandments explained, the ſecond was added to the firſt, but the Words, <hi>For I am the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. were left out. It was declared, that no Godly Honour was to be done unto Images, and that they ought only to be reverenced, for their ſakes whom they repreſented: therefore the preferring of one Image to another, and the making Pilgrimages and Offerings to them, was condemned; but the cenſing them or kneeling before them was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet the People were to be taught that theſe things were done only to the Honour of God. Invocation of Saints, as Interceſſors, was allowed, but immediate Addreſſes to them for the Bleſſings that were prayed for, was condemned. The ſtrict reſt from Labour on the ſeventh day, was declared to be Ceremonial; but it was neceſſary to reſt from Sin, and Carnal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to follow Holy Duties. The other Commandments were explained in a
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170737:143"/>very plain and practical way. Then was the Lord's Prayer explained, and it was aſſerted that the People ought only to pray in their Vulgar Tongues, for exciting their Devotion the more: The Angels Salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Virgin was alſo paraphraſed, They handled Free-will and defined it to be a Power by which the Will guided by Reaſon, did without conſtraint diſcern and chooſe Good and Evil, the former by the help of God's Spirit, and the latter of it ſelf. Grace was ſaid to be offered to all Men, but was made effectual by the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Free-will to it: and Grace and Free-will did conſiſt well together, the one being added for the help of the other; and therefore Preachers were warned not to depreſs either of them too much, in order to the Exaltation of the other. Men were juſtified freely by the Grace of God, but that was applied by Faith, in which both the Fear of God, Repentance, and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life were included. All curious reaſonings about Predeſtination were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; for Men could not be aſſured of their Election, but by feeling the Motions of God's Holy Spirit appearing in a good and a vertuous Life, and perſevering in that to the end. Good Works were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which were not the Superſtitious Inventions of Monks and Friars, nor only moral Good Works done by the Power of Nature, but were the Works of Charity flowing from a pure Heart and Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned: Faſting and the other Fruits of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170737:143"/>Pennance were alſo Good Works; but of an Inferiour Nature to Juſtice and the other Vertues: Good Works were meritorious, yet ſince they were wrought in Men by God's Spirit; all boaſting was excluded. They ended with an account of Prayer for Souls departed, almoſt the ſame that was in the Articles publiſhed before.</p>
               <p>The Book was writ in a plain and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine Stile, fit for weak Capacities,
<note place="margin">The Book is publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and yet ſtrong and weighty: and the parts of it that related to Practice were admirable. To this they added a Preface, declaring the Care they had uſed in examining the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Antient Doctors, out of whom they compiled this Book. The King ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another Preface, in which he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Hypocriſy and Superſtition of one ſort, and the Preſumption of another ſort; to correct both, he had ordered this Book to be made, and publiſhed: and he required his People to read and print it in their Hearts, and to pray to God to grant them the Spirit of Humility for receiving it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: And he charged the Inferiour Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to remember that their Office was not to teach, but to be taught, and to practiſe what they heard, rather than diſpute about it. But this Preface was not added till two Years after the Book was put out; for it mentions the Approbation that was given to it in Parliament, and the Reſtraint that was put on reading the Scriptures, of which an account ſhall be given after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:170737:144"/>
               <p>The Reformers were diſſatisfied with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in the Book, yet were glad to find the Morals of Religion ſo well opened; for the Purity of Soul, which that might effect, would diſpoſe People to ſound Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; many Superſtitious Practices were alſo condemned, and the Goſpel-Covenant was rightly ſtated. One Article was alſo aſſerted in it, which opened the way to a further Reformation; for every National Church was declared to be a compleat Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with Power to reform Hereſies, and do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that was neceſſary for preſerving its own Purity, or governing its Members. The Popiſh Party thought they had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered much Ground, that ſeemed loſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: They knew the Reformers would never ſubmit to all things in this Book, which would alienate the King from them; but they were ſafe, being reſolved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with him in every thing, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing that, it was like to be ſomewhat uneaſy to live in <hi>England;</hi> for the King's Peeviſhneſs grew upon him with his Age. Now the Correſpondence between the King and the <hi>German</hi> Princes fell upon the Change that was made in the Miniſtry, and a ſecret Treaty was ſet on foot between the King and the Emperour. All the Changes that the Committee appointed for the Ceremonies made, was only the Raſure of ſome Offices and Collects, and the ſetting out of a new Primer, with the Vulgar De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions for the Common People: But the Changes were not ſo great, as that it was
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170737:144"/>neceſſary to reprint the Miſſals or Brevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; for the old Books were ſtill made uſe of. Yet theſe Raſures were ſuch, that in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time the old Books were all called in, and the Nation was put to the Charge of buying new ones, which was conſiderable, ſo great was the Number of the Books of Offices.</p>
               <p>The Popiſh Party ſtudied now to engage the King into new Severities againſt the Reformers;
<note place="margin">Barnes <hi>and others fall into Trouble.</hi>
                  </note> the firſt Inſtances of theſe fell on three Preachers, <hi>Barnes, Gerrard,</hi> and <hi>Jerome,</hi> who had been early wrought on by <hi>Luther</hi>'s Books. <hi>Barnes</hi> had during <hi>Wolſey</hi>'s Greatneſs, reflected much on him in a Sermon which he preached at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg;</hi> but <hi>Gardiner</hi> was then his Friend, and brought him off; he having abjured ſome Articles that were objected to him: yet upon new Complaints he was again put in Priſon, but he made his Eſcape and fled to <hi>Germany;</hi> and became ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he was ſent over to <hi>England</hi> by the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> as Chaplain to his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours; but he went back again. The Biſhop of <hi>Hereford</hi> meeting him at <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cald,</hi> ſent him over to <hi>England,</hi> with a ſpecial Recommendation to <hi>Cromwell:</hi> he was after that, much imployed in the Negotiations which the King had with the <hi>Germans;</hi> and had the misfortune to be the firſt that was ſent with the Propoſition for <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve.</hi> In Lent this Year <hi>Bonner</hi> appointed thoſe three to have their turns at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs; <hi>Gardiner</hi> preached alſo
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170737:145"/>there, and fell on Juſtification, which he handled according to the Notions of the Schools: But <hi>Barnes</hi> and the other two did directly refute his Sermon, when it came to their turns to preach, not without indecent Reflections on his Perſon. This was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King as a great Inſolence, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both a Biſhop and a Privy Counſellour; ſo the King commanded them to go and give him Satisfaction: he ſeemed to carry the matter with much Moderation, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgave all that was perſonal, tho it was believed that it ſtuck deep in him. In Concluſion, they confeſſed their Indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and promiſed for the future to be more cautious, and renounced ſome Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of which it was thought their Sermons ſavoured; as that God was the Author of Sin, that Good Works were not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation, and that Princes ought not to be obeyed in all their juſt Laws. Some other Niceties were in diſpute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Juſtification; but the King thought theſe were not of ſuch Conſequence, that it was neceſſary to make them abjure them. <hi>Barnes</hi> and his Friends were required to preach a Recantation Sermon at the Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and to ask <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s Pardon; but tho they obeyed this, yet it was ſaid that in one place, they juſtified what they recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in another; at which the King was ſo much provoked, that without hearing them, he ſent them to the <hi>Tower.</hi> At that time <hi>Cromwell</hi> either could not protect them, or would not interpoſe in a matter
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170737:145"/>which gave the King ſo great Offence. When the Parliament came, they were attainted of Hereſy, without being brought to make their Anſwers: no particular Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors were objected to them, only they were condemned to be burnt as deteſtable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks in general Words. In the ſame Act by which they were condemned: four other were attainted of Treaſon, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confederated with <hi>Reginald Pool,</hi> and for intending to ſurprize <hi>Calais,</hi> and as there was a ſtrange mixture in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, ſo the like was in their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for <hi>Abel Featherſton,</hi> and <hi>Powell,</hi> that were attainted in the ſame Parliament for owning the Pope's Supremacy, were executed with them, and were coupled together in the Hurdles in which they were carried to <hi>Smithfield;</hi> the King in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting an extravagant Appearance of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality in his Juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barnes</hi> being tied to the Stake,
<note place="margin">And burnt</note> went over the Articles of the Creed, and declared his Belief of them all; and that he abhorred the impious Opinions of ſome <hi>German</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts. He aſſerted the neceſſity of Good Works, but aſcribed Juſtification wholly to the Merits of Chriſt; he profeſſed all due Reverence to the Saints; but ſaid he ſaw no Warrant to pray for them; he asked the Sheriff and the People, if they knew for what they were condemned, and what Hereſies they were accuſed of: but none made Anſwer; he prayed God to forgive all that ſought their Death, and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170737:146"/>in particular, <hi>Gardiner,</hi> if he had done it: then prayed for the King and the Prince, and expreſſed his Loyalty to the King; that he believed all his juſt Laws were to be obeyed for Conſcience ſake, and that in no Caſe it was lawful to reſiſt him: he ſent ſome Deſires to the King, as that he would apply the Abby-Lands to good Uſes, and the Relief of his poor Subjects; that he would puniſh the Contempt of Marriage that was ſo common, and would put a ſtop to the Liberty many took of caſting off their Wives, and living in Whoredom; that Swearers might be puniſhed, and that ſince the King had begun to ſet forth the Chriſtian Religion, that he would go on with it; for a great deal remained yet to be done: he asked the Forgiveneſs of all People whom he might have at any time offended, and ſo turned and prepared himſelf for Death: then the other two ſpoke to the ſame purpoſe; they declared their Faith, and exhorted the People to a good Life, and mutual Love; and they all pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and embraced one another; after that, the Fire was ſet to. The Conſtancy they expreſſed, together with the Gentleneſs of their Deportment towards their Enemies, made great Impreſſions on the Spectators, and caſt a heavy Imputation on <hi>Gardiner,</hi> as the Procurer of their Deaths, tho he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelf in an Apology which he prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; in which he denied any other Acceſſion to it, but giving his Vote to the Bill of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder. <hi>Bonner</hi> began now to ſhew himſelf in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170737:146"/>his own Colours: He had courted <hi>Cromwell</hi> more than any Perſon whatſoever; yet the very day after his Diſgrace, he ſhewed his Ingratitude; for <hi>Grafton</hi> that had printed the Bible, and was much in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Favour upon that account, meeting <hi>Bonner,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his Sorrow for <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s being ſent to the <hi>Tower;</hi> but the other anſwered, that it had been good he had been there much ſooner: <hi>Grafton</hi> ſaw his Error in ſpeaking ſo freely, and went from him: but ſome Verſes being printed in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Praiſe; <hi>Bonner</hi> informed the Council what <hi>Grafton</hi> had ſaid to him, and ſo thought it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he had printed them, yet he had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Friends that he was let go. He procured many to be indicted upon the Act of the ſix Articles; but an Order came from the King to ſtop further Proceedings; yet he pick'd out one Inſtance which did equally diſcover his brutal Cruelty, and his want of Judgment. One <hi>Mekins</hi> not above fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years old, had ſaid ſomewhat againſt the Corporal Preſence, and in Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dr. <hi>Barnes:</hi> The Witneſſes differed in their Evidence, one ſwore he had ſaid the Sacrament was only a <hi>Ceremony;</hi> the other ſwore he had ſaid it was only a <hi>Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> ſo two Grand Juries returned an <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus</hi> on the Bill; upon which he fell into a fit of Curſing and violent Rage, and he made the ſecond Grand Jury go aſide and conſider better of it, they being terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, found the Bill, and he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be burnt; but hoping to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170737:147"/>by what he ſhould ſay at the Stake; he railed at <hi>Barnes,</hi> and praiſed <hi>Bonner</hi> much: yet that did not ſave him. Two were burnt at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and two at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> upon the ſame Statute; beſides great Numbers that were put in Priſon.</p>
               <p>In the end of this Year,
<note place="margin">New Sees founded.</note> the King began to endow the new Biſhopricks: <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was the firſt, in which he endowed a Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, a Deanry, 12 Prebendaries, a Quire, and other Officers. The Year after this, he endowed <hi>Cheſter, Gloceſter,</hi> and <hi>Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough;</hi> but in theſe Cathedrals he only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed ſix Prebendaries; two Years after he likewiſe endowed <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Briſtol.</hi> The Foundations had Preambles are almoſt the ſame with that of the Act of Parliament that empowred him to erect them; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the Biſhops to thoſe Sees by a ſpecial Writ; tho that was to go thereafter in the way of Election, as it was in the other Sees: he alſo converted the Priories of <hi>Canterbury, Wincheſter, Dureſme, Worceſter, Ely, Rocheſter,</hi> and <hi>Carlile,</hi> into Collegiate Churches, conſiſting of Deans and Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries. But as all this came much far ſhort of what the King had at firſt intended; ſo the Channel in which thoſe Foundations run, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much from what <hi>Cranmer</hi> had proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, whoſe Intereſt was ſo low at Court, that his Opinion was not now regarded as it had been formerly. He intended to have reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Cathedrals to what they had been at firſt, to be Colleges and Nurſeries for the Dioceſs, and to have ſet up Readers of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170737:147"/>Learned Tongues, and of Divinity, in them, that ſo a conſiderable number of young Clerks might have been trained up under the Biſhop's Eye, both in their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and in a Courſe of Devotion; to be by him, put afterwards in Livings, according to their Merit and Improvements. The want of ſuch Houſes for the ſtrict Education of thoſe who are to ſerve in the Church, has been the occaſion of many fatal Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſince that time, by the Scandals which Men initiated to the Sacred Functions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were well prepared for them, have given the World. The Popiſh Party beyond Sea cenſured theſe Endowments, both as being a very defective Reſtitution of the Lands that had been invaded, and as an Invaſion on the Spiritual Authority, when the King divided Dioceſſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved Churches from one Juriſdiction and put them under another. To which it was anſwered, That as their Practices againſt the King had put him to ſuch a charge, that he could not execute what he at firſt intended; ſo both the Roman Emperours, and other Chriſtian Kings, had regulated and divided the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, and made Primates and Patriarchs as they pleaſed. <hi>Ely</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> was taken out of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> only by the King and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; tho P. <hi>Nicolaus</hi> did officiouſly ſend a Confirmation of it, that being an Art of the Papacy to offer Confirmations unſought; and afterwards to found a Right on ſuch a Precedent: So that the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170737:148"/>receiving a Confirmation, was made to paſs, for an acknowledgment of an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in that See to grant it; upon which the Popes afterwards pretended, that ſuch things could not be done without their conſent. Here the Series of the King's Advances towards a Reformation, ends; what he did after this, was by Starts, backwards or forwards, as the humour took him: Nor was he ſteady in his Councils in State-Affairs: He had no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter about him, that had an Aſcendent over him. Sickneſs and Years increaſed his Imperious Temper; ſo that his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors had a hard task to pleaſe him, and many Errours were committed by him.</p>
               <p>A new Impreſſion of the Bible was at this time finiſhed:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1541"/>
                  <note place="margin">The Bible ſet up in Churches.</note> And the King required all Pariſhes to provide one of them by the next <hi>All-hallowtide,</hi> under the pain of 40 <hi>s.</hi> a Month after that, till they had got one. The People were alſo charged not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about it, nor to diſturb Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by reading it during the Maſs; but to read it humbly and reverently for their Inſtruction and Edification. Six of theſe were ſet up in divers Places of St. <hi>Pauls:</hi> But <hi>Bonner</hi> being afraid of the Miſchief they might do, poſted up near them an Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to the People, That none ſhould read them with vain Glory, and corrupt Affections, or draw Multitudes about them when they read them. But great numbers gathered about thoſe that read; and ſuch as had good Voices, uſed to be reading
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170737:148"/>them aloud a great part of the Day. Many ſet their Children to School, and when they had learn'd to read, they carri'd them to Church to read the Bibles; ſome began likewiſe to argue from them, particularly againſt taking away the Chalice in the Communion, and the Worſhip in an unknown Tongue. Upon which, <hi>Bonner</hi> ſet up a new Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, and threatned to remove them, if theſe abuſes were not corrected: And upon the Complaints made of thoſe things, the free uſe of the Scriptures was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards much reſtrained. This Year the King added to his former Foundations, two Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiat Churches at <hi>Burton</hi> upon <hi>Trent,</hi> and <hi>Thornton,</hi> conſiſting of a Dean and four Prebendaries apiece. <hi>Cranmer</hi> obſerving the Exceſſes in Biſhops Tables, by which, under the name of Hoſpitality, ſo much was conſumed in great Entertainments, that they were diſabled from more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and profitable Acts of Charity, made a Regulation, that an Archbiſhop ſhould not have above ſix Diſhes of Meat, and four of Banquet; a Biſhop not above five, of Meat, and four of Banquet; a Dean or Arth-deacon, not above four, and two of the one, and the other; and Inferiour Church-men might not have above two Diſhes. But this did not take effect; and Sumptuous Tables ſtill continued; tho the Revenues were much impaired; and thus beſides the other ill Effects of theſe, a great part of the Church-rents goes for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the Rich, which ſhould be applied to the Poor.</p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:170737:149"/>
               <p>This Summer the King went to <hi>York,</hi> to meet his Nephew the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who promiſed him an Enterview there. He was an Extraordinary Prince,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of</hi> Scotland.</note> a great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, both of Learning and Juſtice; but out of meaſure addicted to his Pleaſures. The Clergy of <hi>Scotland</hi> were very Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of his ſeeing his Uncle, leſt King <hi>Henry</hi> might have perſwaded him to follow the Copy he had ſet to his Neighbours: and they uſed ſuch perſwaſions, that theſe ſeconded by a Meſſage from <hi>France,</hi> divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King from his purpoſe. Here I ſhall digreſs a little, to give an account of the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at this time. The long Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance between <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> made that <hi>Paris</hi> was the place where the Learned of that Nation had their Education: Yet after the Year 1412, Learning came to have more footing there, and Univerſities were ſet up in ſeveral Epiſcopal Sees. At the ſame time, ſome of <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Followers began to creep into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and one <hi>Resby,</hi> an Engliſhman, was burnt (1407) for teaching ſome Opinions contrary to the Pope's Authority. Some Years after that, <hi>Paul Craw,</hi> an <hi>Huſſite</hi> and <hi>Bohemian,</hi> was burnt, for infuſing the Opinions of that Party, into ſome at St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> About the end of that Century, <hi>Lollardy,</hi> as it was then called, was ſpread into many parts of the Dioceſs in <hi>Glaſgow:</hi> For which, ſeveral Perſons of Quality were accuſed: But they anſwered the Archbiſhop of that See, with ſuch Aſſurance, that he diſmiſſed
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170737:149"/>them; having admoniſh'd them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with the Faith of the Church, and to beware of new Doctrines. The ſame Spirit of Ignorance, Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Superſtition, had over-run the Clergy there, that was ſo much complained of in the other parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> only it may be ſuppoſed, that in Nations leſs Polite and Learned, it was in Proportion great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then it was elſewhere. The total neglect of the Paſtoral Care, and the groſs Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals of the Clergy, poſſeſſed the People with ſuch Prejudices againſt them, that they were eaſily diſpoſed to hearken to new Preachers. <hi>Patrick Hamilton,</hi> nobly born, Nephew by his Father to the Earl of <hi>Aran,</hi> and to the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> by his Mother, was bred up on deſign to be highly preferred; and had an Abby given him for proſecuting his Studies. He went to travel, and in <hi>Germany</hi> grew ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and being poſſeſſed with their Opinions, he returned to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and laid open the Errours and Corruptions then received in the Church. He was invited to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> to confer concerning theſe Points, upon which he was condemned, and put in Priſon. Articles were objected to him; and upon his refuſing to abjure them, <hi>Beaton,</hi> Archbiſhop of St <hi>Andrews,</hi> with the Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> 3 Biſhops, and 5 Abbots, condemned him, as an obſtinate Heretick, and delivered him to the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Power, and ordered the Execution to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170737:150"/>be that Afternoon; for the King had gone in Pilgrimage to <hi>Roſs;</hi> and they were afraid, leſt upon his Return, <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Friends might have interceeded effectually for him. He was tied to the Stake, and expreſſed great Joyes in his Sufferings, ſince by theſe he was to enter into Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life. A Train of Powder being fired, it did not kindle the Fewel, but only burnt his Face: So a ſtop was made till more Powder was brought; and in that time the Friars call'd oft to him to recant, and pray to the Virgin, and to ſay the <hi>Salve Regina:</hi> One Frier <hi>Campbel,</hi> was very officious among the reſt, who had been oft with him in Priſon. He anſwered him, That he knew he was not an Heretick, and had confeſs'd it to him in private; and he charged him to anſwer for that to God. By this time the Gun-powder was brought, and the Fire was kindled, and he died, often repeating theſe Words, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Soul. Campbel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſoon after, Frantick, and died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Year. Both theſe laid together, made great Impreſſions on the People: And now that theſe Points began to be inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into, many received the new Opinions. <hi>Seaton,</hi> a <hi>Dominican,</hi> the King's Confeſſor, preaching in Lent, ſet out the Nature of true Repentance, and the Method to it, without mixing the Directions which the Friars commonly gave on that Subject; and when another Friar ſhewed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiveneſs of what he had taught, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170737:150"/>himſelf in another Sermon, and reflected on thoſe Biſhops that did not preach, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them <hi>dumb Dogs.</hi> But the Clergy would not meddle with him, till they found him in ill Terms with the King; and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he uſed in reproving him for his Vices, quickly alienated the King from him, upon which they reſolved to fall on him; but he withdrew into <hi>England,</hi> and wrote to the King, taxing the Clergy for their Cruelty, and praying him to reſtrain it. One <hi>Forreſt,</hi> an ignorant Benedictine, was accuſed for having ſpoken Honourably of <hi>Patrick Hamilton,</hi> and was put in Priſon. In Confeſſion to a Friar, he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he thought he was a good Man, and that the Articles for which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, might be defended. The Friar diſcovered this, and it was received as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and upon it he was condemned and burnt. Divers others were brought into the Biſhop's Courts, of whom, the greateſt part abjured; but two were more reſolute: one <hi>Gourley</hi> denied Purgatory, and the Pope's Authority; another was <hi>David Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who being a Fiſherman, had refuſed to pay the Tithe of his Fiſh; and when the Vicar came to take them, he ſaid, the Tithe was taken where the Stock grew, and therefore he threw the tenth Fiſh into the Sea: For this and other Opinions, he was condemned, and they were both burnt at one Stake. Several others were accuſed; of whom ſome fled to <hi>England,</hi> and others went over to <hi>Germany.</hi> The Changes made in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170737:151"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> raiſed in all the People a curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſearching into matters of Religion, and that was always fatal to Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 7th, wrote earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to continue firm to the Catholick Faith: Upon which he called a Parliament, and made new Laws, for maintaining the Pope's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and proceeding againſt <hi>Hereticks;</hi> yet the Pope could not engage him to make War on <hi>England.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> ſent <hi>Barlow,</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> to him, with ſome Books that were written in Defence of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and deſired him to examine them Impartially. He alſo propoſed the Enterview at <hi>York,</hi> and a Match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> the King's eldeſt Daughter; and promiſed that he ſhould be made Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and Lord Lieutenant of the whole Kingdom. Yet the Clergy diverted him from this, and perſwaded him to go in Perſon to <hi>France,</hi> and court the Daughter of that King, <hi>Magdalene.</hi> He married her in <hi>January</hi> 1537; but ſhe died in <hi>May.</hi> She had been bred in the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Court, and ſo was well diſpoſed towards the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Upon her Death, the King married <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Guiſe;</hi> ſhe was a Branch of the Family of all <hi>Europe,</hi> that was moſt zealouſly addicted to the old Superſtition; and her Intereſt joined with the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy's, engaged the King to become a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perſecuter of all that were of another mind.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:170737:151"/>
               <p>The King was very expenſive, both in his Pleaſures, and Buildings; and had a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Race of Baſtards;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ſet on foot in</hi> Scotland.</note> ſo that he came to want Mony much. The Nobility pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to him, the ſeizing on the Abbey-Lands, as his Uncle had done. The Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy on the other hand adviſed him, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſeverely againſt all ſuſpected of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy: By which means, according to the Liſts they ſhewed him, he might raiſe 100000 Crowns a Year: They alſo adviſed him to provide his Children to Abbies, and Priories; and repreſented to him, That if he continued ſtedfaſt in the old Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he would ſtill have a great Party in <hi>England;</hi> and might be made the Head of a League, which was then in Project a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt King <hi>Henry.</hi> This ſo far prevailed with him, that as he made four of his Sons, Abbots and Priors, ſo he gave way to the perſecuting Spirit of the Clergy: Upon which, many were cited to anſwer for <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy;</hi> of theſe many abjured; and ſome were baniſht. A Canon Regular, a Secular Prieſt, two Friars, and a Gentleman, were burnt. <hi>Forreſt,</hi> the Canon Regular, had been reproved by his Ordinary, the Biſhop of <hi>Dunkell,</hi> for meddling with the Scriptures too much. He told him, he had lived long, and had never known what was in the Old or New Teſtament; but contented himſelf with his Portoiſe and Pontifical, and that he might come to repent it, if he troubled himſelf with ſuch Fancſies. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:170737:152"/>was a very moderate Man, and diſliked cruel Proceedings. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> a Friar, and <hi>Kennedy,</hi> a young Man, of 18 Years of Age, were brought before him; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed wonderful Joy, and a ſteady Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in their Sufferings. And after a long diſpute between <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Divines, <hi>Ruſſel</hi> concluded, <hi>This is your Hour, and the Power of Darkneſs; go on, and fill up the Meaſures of your Iniquities.</hi> The Archbiſhop was unwilling to give Sentence; he ſaid, he thought theſe Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions did the Church more Hurt than Good. But thoſe about him, told him, He muſt not take a Way different from the reſt of the Biſhops; and threatned him ſo, that he pronounced Sentence. They were burned; but they gave ſuch Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Patience and Joy, as made no ſmall Impreſſion on all that ſaw it, or heard of it. Among thoſe that were in trouble, <hi>George Buchanan</hi> was one, who at the King's Inſtigations, had writ a very ſharp Poem againſt the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> but was now abandoned by him. He made his Eſcape, and lived 20 Years in Forraign Parts, and at laſt returned to do his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Honour; and what by his Immortal Poems, what by his Hiſtory of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he ſhewed both how great a Maſter he was in the Roman Tongue; and how true a Judge he was, both in Wit, and in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Human Affairs, (if Paſſion had not corrupted him towards the end of his Hiſtory) that he is juſtly to be reckoned
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170737:152"/>the greateſt and beſt of the Modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. So much of the Affairs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Author's Native Country.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> ſtayed not long at <hi>York,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Queen's ill Life is diſcovered.</note> ſince his Nephew came not to him. He ſet out a Proclamation there, inviting all that had been of late oppreſſed, to come in and make their Complaints, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to repair them. This was done to caſt the Load of all paſt Errours upon <hi>Cromwel.</hi> The King was mightily wrought on by the Charms of his Wife; ſo that on the Firſt of <hi>November,</hi> he gave publick thanks to God for the happy Choice he had made: But this did not laſt long; for the next day <hi>Cranmer</hi> came, and gave him an account of the Queen's ill Life, which one <hi>Laſſells</hi> had revealed to him, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing learnt it from his Siſter. She had been very lewd before her Marriage, both with one <hi>Deirham,</hi> and one <hi>Mannock. Cranmer,</hi> by the Advice of the other Privy Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, put this in Writing, and delivered it to the King, not knowing how to open it in Diſcourſe. The King was ſtruck with it, and at firſt inclined to believe it was a Forgery; yet he ordered a ſtrict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry to be made into it, but he quickly found Proof enough; for the Queen had ſo far caſt off both Modeſty, and the Fear of a Diſcovery, that ſeveral Women had been Witneſſes to her Lewdneſs. It alſo appeared, that ſhe had intended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in that ill Courſe, for ſhe had brought <hi>Deirham</hi> into her Service; and

The Queen, after a ſlight denial which ſhe made at firſt, did at laſt confeſs all. <hi>Deirham,</hi> and <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peper,</hi> were executed, and a Parliament was called upon it. When it met, a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee was ſent to examine the Queen: Their Report is recorded only in General, That ſhe confeſſed, but no Particulars are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Upon that they paſs'd an Act, in the Form of a Petition. <q rend="inline">In it they prayed the King, that the Queen and her Complices, with her Bawd the Lady <hi>Rochford,</hi> might be attainted of Treaſon: And that all thoſe who knew of the Queen's Vicious Courſe before her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, might be attainted of Miſpriſion of Treaſon, for not revealing it to the King, before he married her. Among thoſe were, her Father, and Mother, and her Grand-Mother, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> It was alſo declared Treaſon, to know any thing of the Incontinence of any Queen for the future, and not to reveal it. And it was made Treaſon, in any whom the King intended to marry, judging they were Maids, not to reveal it, if they were not ſuch.</q> The Queen and the Lady <hi>Rochford</hi> were beheaded on the 14th of <hi>February.</hi> She confeſſed her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence before her Marriage, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to the laſt that ſhe had broken her
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170737:153"/>Wed-lock, tho the Laſciviouſneſs of her former Life, made the World eaſy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the worſt things of her.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1542"/> All obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Judgments of God on the Lady <hi>Rochford,</hi> who had been ſo inſtrumental in the Ruine of <hi>Ann Bolleyn,</hi> and of her Husband: And when ſhe, to whoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices their Fall was in a great Meaſure aſcribed, was found to be ſo vile a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, it tended much to raiſe their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation again. The attainting her Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and Parents, for not diſcovering her former Lewdneſs, was thought extream Severity: for it had been a hard piece of Duty to the King, in them, to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſuch a Secret: Yet tho they lay ſome time in Priſon, the King pardoned them all afterwards, when his Rage was a little qualified. That other Proviſo, obliging a young Woman to diſcover her own Faultineſs, if the King ſhould make Love to her, was thought a Piece of grievous Tiranny: And upon this, thoſe that rallied that Sex, took occaſion to ſay, that after this, none who was reputed a Maid, could be induced to marry the King: So that it was not ſo much choice, as neceſſity, that made him marry a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, two Years after. Some Hoſpitals were this Year reſigned to the King; but there was good ground to queſtion the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of thoſe Deeds, becauſe by their Statutes it was provided, that the Conſent of all the Fellows, was neceſſary to make their Deeds good in Law. So thoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170737:154"/>were now by a ſpecial Act annulled, and this made way for the Diſſolution of many Hoſpitals.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops ſitting in Convocation,
<note place="margin">A Deſign to ſuppreſs the Bible.</note> took great pains to ſuppreſs the Engliſh Bible; but the King could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on directly to call it in. So they complained much of the Tranſlation then ſet out; and intended to procure a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of that, and then to ſet about a new one, in which it would be eaſy to put ſuch Delayes, that it ſhould not be finiſhed in many Years. <hi>Gardiner</hi> did alſo propoſe a ſingular Conceit, that many of the Latin Words ſhould be ſtill retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Engliſh; for he thought they had either ſuch a Majeſty, or ſo peculiar a Signification, that they could not be fitly rendered. He propoſed an hundred of thoſe, and it ſeems hoped, that if this could be carried, the Tranſlation would be ſo full of Latine Words, that the People ſhould not underſtand it for all its being in Engliſh. <hi>Cranmer,</hi> perceiving that the Bible was the great Eye-ſore of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that they were reſolved to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it by all the means they could think of, procured an Order from the King, referring the Correction of the Tranſlation to the two Univerſities. The Biſhops took this very ill; and all of them, except the Biſhops of <hi>Ely,</hi> and St. <hi>Davids,</hi> proteſted againſt it.

               <p>At this time <hi>Bonner,</hi> gave ſome Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to his Clergy, which had a ſtrain
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170737:154"/>in them, ſo far different from the other parts of his Life, that it is probable, he drew them not himſelf. <q rend="inline">He required his Clergy to read every day a Chapter in the Bible, with ſome Gloſs upon it; and to ſtudy the Book ſet out by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: That they ſhould imploy no Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats, but ſuch as he approved of: That they ſhould take care to inſtruct young Children well, in the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion: That they ſhould not go to Taverns; nor uſe unlawful Games, chiefly on Sundays or Holy-days: That they ſhould perform all the Duties of their Function, decently, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: That they ſhould ſuffer no Plays, nor Enterludes in Churches: And that in their Sermons, they ſhould explain the Goſpel and Epiſtle for the Day; and ſtudy to ſtir up the People to Good Works, and to Prayer; and ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain all the Ceremonies of the Church, but ſhould forbear all railing or the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of fabulous Stories, and ſhould chiefly ſet forth the Excellencies of Vertue, and the Vileneſs of Sin: and that none under the degree of a Biſhop ſhould preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Licenſe.</q>

               <p>In the former times there had been few or no Sermons, except in Lent;
<note place="margin">The way of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that time.</note> for on Holy Days the Sermons were Panegyricks on the Saints, and on the virtue of their Relicks. But in Lent there was a more ſolemn way of preaching; and the Friars maintained their Credit much by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170737:155"/>Sermons they preached in that time, by which they wrought much on the Affections of the People; yet theſe for the moſt part tended moſt to extol ſome of the Laws of the Church, as Faſting, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and other Auſterities, with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Pilgrimages; but they were careful to acquaint the People as little as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, with the true Simplicity of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or the Scriptures; and they ſeemed to deſign rather to raiſe a ſudden Heat, than to work a real Change in their Auditors. They had alſo mixt ſo much out of Legends with their Sermons, that the People came to disbelieve all that they ſaid for the ſake of thoſe Fabulous things, with which their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were embaſed. The Reformers took great care to inſtruct their Hearers in the Fundamentals of Religion, of which they had known little formerly: This made the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion run after theſe Teachers with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Zeal; but they mixed too much Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt the Friars in their Sermons, which was judged indecent in them to do; tho their Hypocriſy and Cheats did in a great meaſure excuſe thoſe Heats: and it was obſerved that our Saviour had expoſed the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in ſo plain a manner, that it did very much juſtify the treating them with ſome Roughneſs; yet it is not to be denied but Reſentments for the Cruelties they or their Friends had ſuffered by their means, might have too much Influence on them. This made it ſeem neceſſary to ſuffer none to preach, at leaſt out of their own Pariſhes,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170737:155"/>without Licence, and many were licenſed to preach as Itinerants. There was alſo a Book of Homilies on all the Epiſtles and Goſpels in the Year, put out, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a plain Paraphraſe of thoſe Parcels of Scripture; together with ſome practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Exhortations founded on them. Many Complaints were made of thoſe that were licenſed to preach, and that they might be able to juſtify themſelves, they began gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to write and read their Sermons: and thus did this Cuſtom begin, in which, what is wanting in the heat and force of Delivery, is much made up by the ſtrength and ſolidity of the Matter; and has produced many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of as excellent Sermons, as have been preached in any Age. Plays and Enterludes were a great Abuſe in that time; in them Mock-Repreſentations were made both of the Clergy and of the Pageantry of their Worſhip. The Clergy complained much of theſe as an Introduction to Atheiſm, when things Sacred were thus laught at; and ſaid, They that begun to laugh at Abuſes, would not ceaſe till they had repreſented all the Myſteries of Religion as ridiculous: The graver ſort of Reformers did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it, but political Men encouraged it; and thought nothing would more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually pull down the Abuſes, that yet remained, than the expoſing them to the ſcorn of the Nation.</p>
               <p>A War did now break out between <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> at the Inſtigation of the King of <hi>France.</hi>

                     <hi>A War with</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> King <hi>Henry</hi> ſet out a
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:170737:156"/>Declaration, pretending that the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> owed Homage to him: and cited many Precedents to ſhew that Homage was done not only by their Kings, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the States; for which Original Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords were appealed to. The <hi>Scots</hi> on the other hand, aſſerted that they were a free and independent Kingdom; that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages antiently made by their Kings, were only for Lands which they had in <hi>England;</hi> and that thoſe more lately made, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offered by Pretenders in the caſe of a doubtful Title, or were extorted by Force: And they ſaid, their Kings could not give up the Rights of a free Crown and People. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> made an In-road into <hi>Scotland,</hi> with 20000 Men in <hi>October:</hi> but after he had burnt ſome ſmall Towns, and waſted <hi>Teviotdale,</hi> he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back to <hi>England.</hi> In the end of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> an Army of 15000 <hi>Scots</hi> with a good Train of Artillery, was brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: They intended to march into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Road. The King went to it in Perſon; but he was at this time, much diſturbed in his Fancy, and thought the Ghoſt of one whom he had unjuſtly put to death, followed him continually; he not only left the Army, but ſent a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to <hi>Oliver Sinclare,</hi> then called his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> to command in chief. This diſguſted the Nobility very much, who were become weary of the Inſolence of that Favourite: ſo they refuſed to march, and were begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſeparate. While they were in this
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170737:156"/>Diſorder, 500 <hi>Engliſh</hi> appeared, and they apprehending it was a fore Party of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s Army, refuſed to fight; ſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fell upon them and diſperſed them: they took all their Ordinance and Baggage, and 1000 Priſoners, of whom 200 were Gentlemen. The chief of theſe were the Earls of <hi>Glencarn</hi> and <hi>Caſſilis:</hi> The News of this ſo over-charged the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy King, that he died ſoon after; leaving only an Infant Daughter newly born to ſucceed him. The Lords that were taken, were brought up to <hi>London,</hi> and lodged in the Houſes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: <hi>Caſſilis</hi> was ſent to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where he received thoſe Seeds of Knowledg, which produced afterwards a great Harveſt in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The other Priſoners were alſo inſtructed to ſuch a degree, that they came to have very different Thoughts of the Changes that had been made in <hi>England,</hi> from what the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Clergy had poſſeſſed them with; who had encouraged their King to engage in the War, both by the aſſurance of Victory, ſince he fought againſt an Heretical Prince, and the Contribution of 50000 Crowns a Year. The King's Death, and the Crowns falling to his Daughter, made the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Council lay hold on this as a proper Conjuncture for uniting the whole Iſland in one: therefore they ſent for the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Lords, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them, the marrying the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to their young Queen; this the <hi>Scots</hi> liked very well, and promiſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1543"/> they were ſent home, and went away much pleaſed both with the Splendor of the King's Court, and with the way of Religion which they had ſeen in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Parliament was called,
<note place="margin">A Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> in which the King had great Subſidies given him, of ſix Shillings in the Pound, to be paid in three Years. A Bill was propoſed for the advancement of true Religion, by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and ſome other Biſhops; for the Spirits of the Popiſh Party were much fallen ever ſince the laſt Queen's Death; yet at this time a Treaty was ſet on foot between the King and the Emperour, which raiſed them a little: for ſince the King was like to engage in a War with <hi>France,</hi> it was neceſſary for him to make the Emperour his Friend. <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Motion was much oppoſed, and the timorous Biſhops for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him; yet he put it as far as it would go,
<note place="margin">An Act about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> tho in moſt Points things went againſt him; <q rend="inline">By it <hi>Tindall</hi>'s Tranſlation of the Bible was condemned as crafty and falſe, and alſo all other Books contrary to the Doctrine ſet forth by the Biſhops. But Bibles of another Tranſlation, were ſtill allowed to be kept, only all Prefaces or Annotations that might be in them, were to be daſhed or cut out: All the King's Injunctions were confirmed: No Books of Religion might be printed without Licence; there was to be no Expoſition
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170737:157"/>of Scripture in Plays or Enterludes; none of the Laity might read the Scripture, or explain it in any publick Aſſembly: But a Proviſo was made for publick Speeches, which then began generally with a Text of Scripture, and were like Sermons. Noblemen, Gentlemen and their Wives, or Merchants might have Bibles, but no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Woman, Tradeſman, Apprentice, or Husbandman, might have any. Every Perſon might have the Book ſet out by the Biſhops, and the Pſalter, and other Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religion in Engliſh. All Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that preached contrary to that Book, for the firſt Offence, were only required to recant; for the ſecond, to abjure and carry a Faggot; but were to be burnt for the third: the Laity for the third Offence were only to forfeit their Goods and Chattels, and to be liable to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Impriſonment; but they were to be proceeded againſt within a Year: The Parties accuſed, were not allowed Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for their Purgation. The Act of the ſix Articles was confirmed, and it was left free to the King, to change this Act, or any Proviſo in it.</q> There was alſo a new Act paſt, giving Authority to the King's Proclamations, and any nine Privy Counſellours were empowered to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Offenders: To this the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> diſſented, and it is the only Inſtance of any Proteſtation againſt any of the publick Acts that paſt in this whole Reign. By the Act about Religion, as the Laity were delivered
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170737:158"/>from the fear of Burning; ſo the Clergy might not be burnt but upon the third Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. The Act being alſo put entirely in the King's Power, he had now the Reformers all at mercy; for he could bind up the Act, or execute it as he pleaſed: and he affected this much to have his People depend entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him. The League offenſive and defenſive for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Calais,</hi> and for the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> was ſworn by the King and the Emperour: and Aſſurances were given, that tho the King would not declare Lady <hi>Mary</hi> legitimate, upon which the Emperour inſiſted much, yet ſhe ſhould be put in the Succeſſion to the Crown next Prince <hi>Edward.</hi> The Emperour was glad thus to engage the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> in a War, by which the <hi>Germans</hi> were left without Support, and ſo he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to carry on his great deſign of making himſelf Maſter of <hi>Germany.</hi>

                  <hi>Hamilton,</hi> next in Blood to the young Queen, was eſtabliſhed in the Government during the Queen's Minority: he was a Man of great Vertue, and much inclined to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; but was ſoft and eaſie to be wrought on. King <hi>Henry</hi> ſent Sir <hi>Ralph Sadler</hi> to him, to induce him to ſet forward the Match; and to offer him Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> to his Son. It was agreed and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Parliament, that the Young Queen ſhould be bred in <hi>Scotland</hi> till ſhe was ten Years old; the King of <hi>England</hi> ſending a Nobleman and his Lady with others not
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:170737:158"/>exceeding twenty, to wait on her: and after that Age, ſhe was to be ſent to <hi>England;</hi> and in the mean while ſix Hoſtages were to be given: but all the Clergy headed by Cardinal <hi>Beaton,</hi> ſet themſelves much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this. The Queen-Mother oppoſed it much, and it was alſo ſaid, a Match with the <hi>French,</hi> would be more for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Nation, who being at ſo great a diſtance, could not oppreſs them ſo eaſily as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might: for if the <hi>French</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt them, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would be ready to protect them, but if they came under the Yoke of <hi>England,</hi> they could expect no Protection from any other Prince. This meeting with that Antipathy that was then formed between the two Nations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inflamed by the Clergy, turned the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally to prefer a Match with <hi>France,</hi> to that which was propoſed for the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> ſent over the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> to make a Party againſt the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; they ſent alſo over the Governour's Baſe-Brother, afterwards made Arch-biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> to take him out of the hands of the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> and he made him appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend great danger if he went on in his Oppoſition to the Intereſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he would be declared illegitimate, as being begotten in a ſecond Marriage, while the firſt that was annulled becauſe of a Precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, did ſubſiſt; for if the annulling the firſt ſhould be reverſed, then the ſecond could be of no force; and if that were once done, the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> who was next
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170737:159"/>to him in blood, would be preferred to him: Theſe threatnings joyned with his Brother's Artifices, had their full Effect on him: for he turned off wholly from the Intereſts of <hi>England,</hi> and gave himſelf up to the <hi>French</hi> Councils. When it was thus reſolved to break the Match with <hi>England;</hi> the Lords that had left Hoſtages for their faithful performing the Promiſes they made to King <hi>Henry,</hi> were little concerned either in their own Honour, or in the ſafety of their Hoſtages: only the Earl of <hi>Caſſilis,</hi> thought it was unworthy of him, to break his Faith in ſuch a manner; ſo he came into <hi>England,</hi> and put himſelf in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Hands, who upon that called him another <hi>Regulus,</hi> but uſed him better; for he gave him his Liberty and a Noble Preſent, and ſent him back with his Hoſtages, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take a ſevere Reparation of thoſe who had failed him in that Kingdom. At the ſame time he began the War with <hi>France;</hi> one of the Reaſons he gave for it was, that <hi>Francis</hi> had failed in the matter of ſhaking off the Pope's Authority, and advancing a Reformation, in which he had promiſed to ſecond him.</p>

Sir <hi>Philip Hobbey,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hains,</hi> Dean of <hi>Exeter,</hi> were alſo put in Priſon. There was a Concordance of the Bible, and ſome Notes upon it, in Engliſh, found written by <hi>Marbeck,</hi> which was look'd on as the Work of ſome learned Man, for it was known that he was illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate. <hi>Marbeck</hi> ſaid, the Notes were his own, gathered by him, out of ſuch Books as he fell on. And for the Concordance, he ſaid, he compiled it by the help of a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Concordance, and an Engliſh Bible, tho he underſtood little Latin. He had brought it to the Letter L. This ſeemed ſo incredible, that it was look'd on only as a Pretence to conceal the true Author; ſo to try him, they gave him ſome Words of the Letter M, and ſhut him up, with a Latin Concordance, and an Engliſh Bible; and by his Performance in that, they clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaw, that the whole Work was his own, and were not a little aſtoniſhed at the Ingeniouſneſs and Diligence of ſo poor a Man. When the King heard of it, he ſaid, <hi>Marbeck</hi> was better imployed than

Dr. <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Simonds</hi> an Attorney, had taken ſome Informations againſt ſeveral Perſons of Quality at Court, and intended to have carried the Deſign very high. But a great Pacquet, in which all their Project was diſcloſed by them, being intercepted, they were ſent for, and examined about it; but they denied it upon Oath, not knowing that their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were taken; and were not a little confounded when their own Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing was ſhewed them. So they were convicted of Perjury, and were ſet on a Pillory, and made ride about with their Faces to the Horſes Tails, and Papers on their Breaſts, in three ſeveral Places, which did ſo affect Dr. <hi>London,</hi> that he died ſoon after.

               <p>The chief thing aimed at by the whole Popiſh Party was <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Ruine; <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner</hi> imploied many to infuſe it into the King, that he gave the chief Encouragement to <hi>Hereſy</hi> of any in <hi>England,</hi> and that it was in vain to lop off the Branches, and leave the Root ſtill growing. The King till then would never hear the Complaints that were made of him: But now to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into the depth of this Deſign, he was willing to draw out all that was to be ſaid againſt him. <hi>Gardiner</hi> reckoned, that this Point being gained, all the reſt would
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170737:160"/>follow: And judged, that the King was now alienated from him; and ſo more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and Artifices than ever were now made uſe of. A long Paper, of many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, both againſt <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, was put in the King's hands.

Then the King told him franckly, That he was the Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, as moſt guilty; and ſhewed him all the Informations that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt him. <hi>Cranmer</hi> confeſſed, he was ſtill of the ſame mind that he was of when he oppoſed the ſix Articles, and ſubmitted himſelf to a Trial: He confeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many things to the King; in particular, that he had a Wife, but he ſaid he had ſent her out of <hi>England,</hi> when the Act of the ſix Articles paſt; and expreſſed ſo great a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and put ſo entire a Confidence in the King, that inſtead of being ruined, he was now better eſtabliſhed with him than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The King commanded him to appoint ſome to examine the Contrivance that was laid to deſtroy him. He anſwered, That it was not decent for him to nominate any to judge in a Cauſe, in which himſelf was concerned: Yet the King was poſitive; ſo
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170737:161"/>ſo he named ſome to go about it, and the whole ſecret was found out. It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and Dr. <hi>London,</hi> had been the chief Sticklers, and had encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged Informers to appear againſt him. <hi>Cranmer</hi> did not preſs the King to give him any Reparation; for he was ſo noted for his readineſs to forgive Injuries, and to do Good for Evil, that it was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, that the beſt way to obtain his Favour, was to do him an Injury; of this he gave ſignal Inſtances at this time, both in Relation to ſome of the Clergy and Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; by which it appeared that he was acted by that meek and lowly Spirit, that became all the Followers of Chriſt; but more particularly one, that was ſo great an Inſtrument in reforming the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and did in ſuch eminent Acts of Charity, ſhew that he himſelf practiſed that, which he taught others to do.</p>
               <p>A Parliament was now called,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1544"/>
                  <note place="margin">The Act of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</note> in which the great Act of Succeſſion to the Crown paſt: <q rend="inline">By it the Crown was firſt provided to Prince <hi>Edward</hi> and his Heirs, or the Heirs by the King's preſent Marriage; after them to Lady <hi>Mary</hi> and Lady <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> and in caſe they had no Iſſue, or did not obſerve ſuch Limitations or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as the King ſhould appoint, then it was to fall to any other whom the King ſhould name, either by his Letters Patents, or by his laſt Will ſigned with his Hand. An Oath was appointed both againſt the Pope's Supremacy, and for the maintaining
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:170737:161"/>Succeſſion according to this Act, which all were required to take, under the pains of Treaſon: It was made Treaſon to ſay or write any thing contrary to this Act, or to the Slander of any of the King's Heirs named in it.</q> By this, tho the King did not Legitimate his Daughters, yet it was made Criminal for any to object Baſtardy to them. Another Act paſt, qualifying the Severity of the Act of the ſix Articles; none were to be impriſoned but upon a Legal Preſentment, except upon the King's Warrant. None was to be challenged for Words, but within a Year; nor for a Sermon, but within 40 Days. This was made to prevent ſuch Conſpiracies as had been diſcovered the former Year. Another Act paſt, renewng the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given to 32 to reform the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law, which <hi>Cranmer</hi> promoted much; and to ſet it forward, he drew out of the Canon Law, a Collection of many things againſt the Regal, and for the Papal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, with ſeveral other very Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Propoſitions, to ſhew how Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent a thing it was, to let a Book, in which ſuch things were, continue ſtill in any credit in <hi>England:</hi> But he could not bring this to any good Iſſue, during this Reign. Another Act paſt, diſcharging all the King's Debts; and they alſo required ſuch as had received payment to bring back the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into the Exchequer. This was tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a piece of groſs Injuſtice; and it was thought ſtrange, that ſince the King had
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170737:162"/>done this once before, he could have the credit to raiſe more Mony, and be tempted to do it a ſecond time. A General Pardon was granted, out of which, <hi>Hereſy</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
               <p>The King was now engaged in a War,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The King makes War on</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> both with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and to make his Treaſure hold out the longer, he embaſed the Coin in a very Extraordinary manner. The Earl of <hi>Hartford</hi> was ſent with an Army by Sea to <hi>Scotland;</hi> he landed at <hi>Grantham,</hi> a little above <hi>Leith.</hi> He burnt both <hi>Leith</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> but he neither ſtaied to take the Caſtle of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> nor did he Fortify <hi>Leith,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſted the Country, all the Way from that to <hi>Berwick.</hi> He did too much if it was intended to gain the Hearts of that Nation; and too little if it was intended to ſubdue them; for this did only inflame their Spirits more, by which, they were ſo united in their Averſion to <hi>England,</hi> that the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> who had been caſt off by <hi>France,</hi> and was gone over to the Engliſh Intereſt, could make no Party in the Weſt, but was forced for his own Preſervation to fly into <hi>England. Audley</hi> the Chancellour, dying at this time, <hi>Wrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſly,</hi> that was of the Popiſh Party, was put in his place: And Dr. <hi>Petre,</hi> that was hitherto <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Friend, was made Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State: So equally did the King keep the Ballance between both Parties, and being to croſs the Seas, he left a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for the Adminiſtration of Affairs,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170737:162"/>during his Abſence, to the Queen, the Archbiſhop, the Chancellour, the Earl of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Petre:</hi> And if they ſhould have any occaſion to raiſe any Force, he appointed the Earl of <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> his Lieutenant. He gave order alſo to Tranſlate the Prayers, and Proceſſions, and Litanies, into the Engliſh Tongue, which gave the Reformers ſome hopes again, that he had not quite caſt off his Deſignes of corrupting ſuch Abuſes, as had crept into the Worſhip of God. And they hoped, That the Reaſons which prevailed with the King for this, would alſo induce him to order a Tranſlation, of all the other Offices into the Engliſh Tongue.</p>
               <p>The King croſſed the Sea with great Pomp,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The King takes</hi> Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loign.</note> the Sails of his Ship being of Cloth of Gold. He ſat down before <hi>Bulloign,</hi> and took it after a Siege of two Months. It was ſoon after very near being retaken by a Surpriſe, but the Gariſon being quickly put in order, beat out the French. Thus the King returned Victorious; and was as much flattered for taking this ſingle Town, as if he had conquered a Kingdom. The Inroads that were made into <hi>Scotland</hi> this Winter, were Inſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> ſet out a Fleet of above 300 Ships;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1545"/> and the King ſet out a hundred Sail: On both ſides they were only Merchant-men hired upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The French made two Deſcents upon <hi>England,</hi> but was beat back with
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170737:163"/>loſs. The Engliſh made a Deſcent in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> and burnt ſome Towns. The Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> ſaw their Danger, if this War went on; for the Pope and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had made a League for procuring Obedience to the Council, that was now opened at <hi>Trent.</hi> The Emperour was raiſing an Army, tho he had made Peace both with the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Turk; and was reſolved to make good uſe of this Opportunity, the two Crowns being now in War. So the Germans ſent to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate a Peace between them: but it ſtuck long at the buſineſs of <hi>Bulloign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lee,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> died this Year. <hi>Holgate</hi> was removed from <hi>Landaffe</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who in his Heart favoured the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. <hi>Kitchin</hi> was put in <hi>Landaffe,</hi> who turned with every Change that was made. <hi>Heath</hi> was removed from <hi>Rocheſter</hi> to <hi>Worceſter;</hi> and <hi>Holbeach</hi> was put in <hi>Rocheſter. Day</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter.</hi> All thoſe were moderate Men, and well diſpoſed to a Reformation, at leaſt to comply with it.</p>
               <p>This Year <hi>Wiſhart</hi> was burnt in <hi>Scotland:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wiſhart <hi>burnt in</hi> Scotland.</note> He was Educated at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and went home the former Year. In many places he preached againſt Idolatry, and the other Abuſes in Religion. He ſtayed long at <hi>Dundee;</hi> but by the means that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Beaton</hi> uſed, he was driven out of that Town; and at his Departure, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced heavy Judgments on them, for rejecting the Goſpel. He went and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170737:163"/>in many other places, and Enterance to the Churchs being denied him, he preached in the Fields. He would not ſuffer the People to open the Church Doors by Violence, for that, he ſaid, became not the Goſpel of Peace which he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them. He heard the Plague had broke out in <hi>Dundee,</hi> within four Days after he was baniſhed; ſo he returned thither, and took care of the Sick, and did all the Offices of a faithful Paſtor among them. He ſhewed his Gentleneſs towards his Enemies, by reſcuing a Prieſt that was coming to kill him, but was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and was like to have been torn in pieces by the People. He foretold ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral extraordinary things; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own Sufferings, and the ſpreading the Reformation over the Land. He preached laſt in <hi>Lothian,</hi> and there the Earl of <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> took him, but promiſed upon his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that no harm ſhould be done him; yet he delivered him to the Cardinal, who brought him to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and called a Meeting of Biſhops thither, to deſtroy him with the more Solemnity. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour being much preſt to it, by a Worthy Gentleman of his Name, <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Preſton,</hi> ſent the Cardinal word not to proceed againſt him, till he ſhould come and hear the Matter examined himſelf. But the Cardinal went on, and in a publick Court condemned him as an Heretick, upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Articles that were objected to him, which he confeſſed, and offered to juſtify.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170737:164"/>The Night after that he ſpent in Prayer; next Morning he deſired he might have the Sacrament according to Chriſt's Inſtitution in both kinds; but that being denied him, he conſecrated the Elements himſelf, and ſome about him were willing to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with him. He was carried out to the Stake near the Cardinal's Palace; who was ſet in State in a great Window, and looked on this ſad Spectacle. <hi>Wiſhart</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he felt much Joy within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in offering up his Life for the Name of Chriſt, and exhorted the People not to be offended at the Word of God, for the ſake of the Croſs. After the Fire was ſet to and was burning him, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">This Flame hath ſcorched my Body, but hath not daunted my Spirits; and he foretold that the Cardinal ſhould in a few days be ignominiouſly laid out in that very place where he now ſate in ſo much State;</q> but as he ſpeak that, the Executioner drew the Cord that was about his Neck ſo ſtrait, that theſe were the laſt Words.</p>
               <p>The Clergy rejoyced much at his Death,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cardinal</hi> Beaſon is murdered.</note> and extolled the Cardinal's Courage, for proceeding in it againſt the Governours Orders. But the People look'd on him as both a Prophet and a Martyr. It was alſo ſaid that his Death was no leſs than Murder, ſince no Writ was obtained for it; and the Clergy could burn none without a Warrant from the Secular Power: ſo it was inferred that the Cardinal deſerved to dy for it; and if his Greatneſs ſet him
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170737:164"/>above the Law, then Private Perſons might execute that which the Governour could not do: Such Practices had been formerly too common in that Kingdom; and now upon this occaſion ſome Gentlemen of quality came to think it would be an Heroical Action to conſpire his Death. His Inſolence had rendred him generally very hateful: ſo private and publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments concurring, twelve Perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a fatal Engagement of killing him privately in his Houſe. On the 30th of <hi>May,</hi> they firſt ſurprized the Gate early in the Morning, and tho there were an hundred lodged in the Caſtle, yet they being aſleep, they came to them apart, and either turned them out, or ſhut them up in their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: Having made all ſure, they came to the Cardinal's Chamber-door; he was faſt aſleep, but by their Rudeneſs, he was both awakened, and perceived they had a deſign on his Life: Upon the aſſurance of Life, he opened his Door, but they did cruelly and treacherouſly murder him, and laid out his Body in the ſame Window, from which he had looked on <hi>Wiſharts</hi> Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Some few juſtified this Fact, as the killing of a Robber and Murderer; but it was more generally condemned by all ſorts of People, even by thoſe who hated him moſt; yet the Accompliſhment of <hi>Wiſhart</hi>'s Prediction made great Impreſſions on many. On the other hand, it was afterwards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that ſcarce any of the Conſpirators died an ordinary Death. They kept out
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170737:165"/>the Caſtle, and about 140 came in to them, and they held it near two Years, being aſſiſted both by Mony and Proviſions that were ſent from <hi>England.</hi> They had alſo the Govenour at their Mercy, for they kept his eldeſt Son, whom the Cardinal had taken into his Care for his Education. An Abſolution was brought from <hi>Rome,</hi> and a Pardon was offered them; and at laſt, being ſtraitned both at Sea and Land, they rendred the Place upon Aſſurance of Life. This Infamous Action was a great Blemiſh upon the Reformers, who, tho they did not directly juſtify it, yet extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and gave it ſome Countenance; for two of them went in and preached to the Garriſon in the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>In <hi>England</hi> a Parliament met,
<note place="margin">Chantries given to the King.</note> in which as the Spiritualty gave a Subſidy of ſix Shillings in the Pound, payable in two Years; ſo the Temporalty not only gave a Subſidy for the War, but confirmed all the Surrenders that had been made of Chantries, Chappels, Colledges, Hoſpitals, and other Foundations, for ſaying Maſſes for departed Souls: and they empowered the King during his Life to grant Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for ſeizing on the reſt of them. Yet the King found this was like to give new Diſcontent to the Gentry, to whom theſe belonged, ſo he made but a ſmall Progreſs in it, and many were reſerved to his Sons Courtiers to feed on. The King diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Parliament with a long Speech, <q rend="inline">In which after he had thanked them for their
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170737:165"/>Bills, he exhorted them to Charity and Concord in matters of Religion; and to forbear all Terms of Reproach,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1546"/> ſuch as <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Heretick:</hi> he complained much of the Stifneſs of ſome Church-men, and of the Indiſcretion of others, who both gave ill Example, and ſowed the Seeds of Diſcord among the Laity. He, as God's Vicar, thought himſelf bound to ſee theſe things corrected: he reproved the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralty for the ill uſe they made of the Scripture; for inſtead of being taught out of it to live better, and to be more charitable to one another, they only railed at one another, and made Songs out of it, to diſgrace thoſe that differed from them; ſo he exhorted them to ſerve God, and love one another, which he would eſteem the beſt Expreſſion of their Duty and Obedience to him.</q> The King had appointed a Diſtribution of 550 <hi>l.</hi> a year in ſeveral Cathedrals, for the Poor, and about 400 <hi>l.</hi> for High-ways; ſo this Year ſome Biſhops were appointed to ſee whether thoſe Payments were made as he had ordered or not. The Univerſities were now in danger of having their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges ſuppreſt, but upon their Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the King, they were delivered from their Fears.</p>
               <p>Now came on the laſt Year of this Reign,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A Peace with</hi> France.</note> the War with <hi>France</hi> was this Year unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful, but upon the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi>'s being recalled, and the Earl of <hi>Hartford</hi>'s being ſent in his room, things turned a little.
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170737:166"/>This raiſed ſuch Animoſity between thoſe two Lords, that they became fatal to the former. The two Kings were at laſt brought to conſent to a Peace; the main Article of it was, that within eight Years <hi>Bulloigne</hi> ſhould be delivered up, the taking and keeping of which, coſt <hi>England</hi> 1300000 <hi>l.</hi> Upon this Peace <hi>Annebault</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Admiral, was ſent over Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was now ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>Pool</hi> was made a Legate to do the King the more Spite: the Emperour and the Pope governed it as they pleaſed: ſo the two Crowns reſolved to unite more firmly; particularly it was propoſed, that the Maſs ſhould be turned to a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and <hi>Cranmer</hi> was ordered to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Office for it. But this was too great a Deſign for two old Kings to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh.</p>
               <p>There was at this time a new Proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe that denied the Corporal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the Sacrament,
<note place="margin">Anne Aiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough <hi>and others burnt.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Shaxton</hi> was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſome Words about it, but he abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and complied ſo entirely, that ſoon after he preached the Sermon at the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Anne Aiſcough;</hi> he made no noiſe all King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, yet in Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Reign, he was a Perſecutor of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, but was ſo little eſteemed, that tho he had been Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> he was raiſed no higher than to be Biſhop Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of <hi>Ely.</hi> Several other Perſons were at this time endicted upon the ſame Statute, but moſt of them recanted; <hi>Anne Aiſcough</hi>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:170737:166"/>ſtood firm, ſhe was deſcended from a good Family, and had been well educated, but was unhappily married; for her Husband being a violent Papiſt, drove her out of his Houſe, when he diſcovered her Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Reformation; ſhe was put in Priſon on the account of the Sacrament, but ſigned a Recantation, and ſo was ſet at Liberty; yet not long after ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted again upon a new Complaint, and was examined before the Privy Council, but anſwered with extraordinary Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet it was thought by ſome that ſhe was too forward in her manner of ſpeaking: ſhe had been much at Court, and it was believed ſhe was ſupported by ſome Ladies there: ſo in order to the Diſcovery of this, ſhe was carried to the <hi>Tower</hi> and rack'd; yet ſhe confeſs'd nothing. <hi>Wriotheſly</hi> was preſent, and commanded the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> to draw the Rack a little more, but he refuſed to do it; upon which the Chancellour laid aſide his Gown and drew it himſelf with ſo much Force, as if he had intended to rend her Body aſunder; and the Effects of this were ſo violent, that ſhe was not able to go to <hi>Smithfield,</hi> but was carried thither in a Chair when ſhe was burnt: Two others were alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned on the ſame account, and <hi>Shaxton</hi> to compleat his Apoſtacy, after he had in vain endeavoured to perſwade them to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure, preached the Sermon at their Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which he inveighed ſeverely againſt their Errors. The Lord Chancellour came
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170737:167"/>to <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and offered them their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons if they would recant, but they choſe rather to glorify God by their Deaths, than to diſhonour him by ſo foul an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy. There were two burnt in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and one in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> on the ſame account, this Year.</p>
               <p>But the Popiſh Party hoped to have greater Sacrifices offered up to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deſigns againſt</hi> Cranmer</note> They had laid a Train laſt Year for <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and they had laid one now for the Queen. They perſwaded the King, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> was the Source of all the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy that was in <hi>England;</hi> but the King's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality to him was ſuch, that none would come in againſt him: So they deſired, that he might be once put in the Tower, and then it would appear how many would inform againſt him. The King ſeemed to conſent to this; and they reſolved to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it the next day: but in the Night the King ſent for <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and told him, what was reſolved concerning him. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> thanked the King for giving him notice of it, and not leaving him to be ſurpriſed. He ſubmitted to it, only he deſired he might be heard anſwer for himſelf; and that he might have indifferent Judges who underſtood thoſe matters. The King won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to ſee him ſo little concerned in his own Preſervation; but told him, he muſt take care of him, ſince he took ſo little care of himſelf.

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170737:167"/>he ſhould be ſent to the Tower; and that he might be uſed by them, as they would deſire to be uſed in the like Caſe: And if he could not prevail by the force of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then he was to appeal to the King in Perſon, and was to ſhew the King's Seal-Ring, which he took from his Finger and gave him; and they knew it all ſo well, that they would do nothing after they once ſaw that; ſo he being ſummoned next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, came over to <hi>White-Hall:</hi> He was kept long in the Lobbey before he was called in: But when that was done, and he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Method the King had ordered him to uſe, and had at laſt ſhewed the Ring, they roſe all in great Confuſion, and went to the King. He chid them ſeverely for what they had done, and expreſſed his Eſteem and Kindneſs to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> in ſuch Terms, that his Enemies were glad to get off, by pretending, that they had no other Deſign, but to have his Innocence declared in a publick Trial; and were now ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the King's unalterable Favour to him, that they never made any more At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts upon him.</p>

He took hold of this Opportunity, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the King, that ſhe was a great Cheriſher of Hereticks. <hi>Wriotheſly</hi> joined with him in the ſame Artifice, and filled the angry King's Head with many Stories; in ſo much, that he ſigned the Articles upon which ſhe was to be Impeached. But <hi>Wrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſly</hi> let that Paper fall from him careleſly, and it happened to be taken up by one of the Queen's Friends, who carried it to her: Upon which ſhe went to the King, and brought on a Diſcourſe of Religion; and after a little Oppoſition, ſhe yielded, and ſeemed convinced by the King's Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and told him, That ſhe only held up that Argument to be inſtructed by him, and ſometimes to engage him in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and ſo to make him forget his pains; and this ſhe ſeconded with ſuch Flattery, that he was perfectly ſatisfied, and reconciled to her. Next day, as he was walking with her in the Garden, <hi>Wrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſly</hi>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:170737:168"/>came thither on deſign to have carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to the Tower; but the King chid him ſeverely for it, and was heard to call him <hi>Knave</hi> and <hi>Fool.</hi> The good natured Queen interpoſed to mitigate his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, but the King told her, She had no reaſon to be concerned for him: Thus the Deſign againſt her, vaniſhed; and <hi>Gardiner</hi> that had ſet it on, loſt the King's Favour entirely by it.</p>
               <p>But now the Fall of the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> and his Son the Earl of <hi>Surry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Duke of</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk's <hi>Fall.</hi>
                  </note> came on. The Father had been long Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and had ſerved the King with great Fidelity and Succeſs: His Son was a Man of rare Qualities; he had a great Wit, and was more than ordinary learned. He particularly hated the Earl of <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and ſcorned an Alliance with him, which his Father had projected. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> had intended to unite his Family to the <hi>Seimours,</hi> by marrying his Son to the Earl of <hi>Hartford</hi>'s Daughter; and his Daughter the Dutcheſs of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> to Sir <hi>Thomas Seimour:</hi> But both his Children refuſed to comply with him in it. The <hi>Seimours</hi> were apprehenſive of the Oppoſition they might meet with, if the King ſhould die, from the Earl of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> who was a high ſpirited Man, had a vaſt Fortune, and was the Head of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Party. It was likewiſe ſuſpected, that he kept himſelf unmarried in hopes of marrying the Lady <hi>Mary.</hi> The Duke's Family was alſo fatally divided: His
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170737:169"/>Dutcheſs had been ſeparated from him, about four Years, and now turned Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer againſt him. His Daughter did alſo hate her Brother, and was a Spy upon him. One <hi>Holland,</hi> a Whore of the Duke's, did alſo betray him, and diſcovered all ſhe could; yet all amounted to no more than ſome Complaints of the Fathers, who thought the Services he had done the Crown were little regarded; and ſome Threatnings of the Sons. It was alſo ſaid, that the Father gave the Coat of Arms that belonged to the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Son gave <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſors Coat; but that was only a Pretence to make a noiſe among the People, and to cover the want of more important matter againſt them. One <hi>Southwel</hi> objected things of a higher Nature to the Earl of <hi>Surry.</hi> He denied them, and deſired, that according to the Martial Law, they might have a Trial by Combate, and fight in their Shirts: But that was not granted; yet both Father and Son were put in the Tower.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Surry</hi> was tried by a Jury of Commoners,

                  </note> and was found guilty of Treaſon, and executed on the 19th of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary.</hi> He was much lamented; and the Blame of his Death being caſt on the <hi>Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> raiſed a General <hi>Odium</hi> againſt them. The old Duke ſaw a Parliament called to deſtroy him by an Act of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for there was not matter enough to ruine him at Common Law; ſo to prevent
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170737:169"/>that he made ſuch humble Submiſſion to the King, as would have mollified any that had not Bowels of Braſs. He wrote to him, <q rend="inline">That he had ſpent his whole Life in his Service, without having ſo much as a Thought to his Prejudice. He had obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the King's Laws, and was reſolved to obey all that ever he ſhould make. He begged that he might be heard, with his Accuſers face to face. He prayed that the King would take all his Lands, and Goods, and only reſtore him to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and grant him ſuch an Allowance to live on, as he thought fit. He went further, and ſet his Hand to a Confeſſion of ſeveral Crimes; as 1. His revealing the Secrets of the King's Council. 2. His concealing his Son's Treaſon, in giving the Arms of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor. 3. His own giving the Arms of <hi>England,</hi> with the Labels of Silver which belonged only to the Prince, which he acknowledged was High Treaſon, and therefore he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the King's Mercy.</q> But all this had no effect on the King, tho his drawing ſo near his end, ought to have begot in him a greater regard to the ſhedding of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood.</p>
               <p>When the Parliament met,
<note place="margin">And the Duke at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the King was not able to come to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> but he ſent his Pleaſure to them by a Commiſſion. He intended to have Prince <hi>Edward</hi> Crowned <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales;</hi> and therefore deſired they would make all poſſible haſt in the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:170737:170"/>Attainder of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> that ſo the Places which he held by Patent, might be diſpoſed of to others, who ſhould aſſiſt at the Coronation; which, tho it was a very ſlight Excuſe, for ſo high a piece of Injuſtice, yet it had that effect, that in ſeven Days, both Houſes paſt the Bill. On the 27th of <hi>January,</hi> the Royal Aſſent was given by thoſe Commiſſioned by the King; and the Execution was ordered to be next Morning. There was no ſpecial Matter in the Act, but that of the Coat of Arms, which he and his Anceſtors were uſed to give, according to Records in the Herauld's Office; ſo that this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by all Perſons, as a moſt Inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Act of Tyranny. But the Night after this, the King died, and it was thought contrary to the Decencies of Government, to begin a new Reign with ſo Unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able an Act, as the beheading of the old Duke, and ſo he was preſerved: Yet both Sides made Inferences from this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity that fell on him. The Papiſts ſaid, It was God's juſt Judgment on him, for his Obſequiouſneſs to King <hi>Henry.</hi> But the Proteſtants ſaid, It was a juſt return on him, for what he had done againſt <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and many others, on the account of the ſix Articles. <hi>Cranmer</hi> would not meddle in this Matter, but that he might be out of the way, he retired to <hi>Croydon,</hi> whereas <hi>Gardiner</hi> that had been his Friend all along, continued ſtill about the Court.</p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:170737:170"/>
               <p>The King's Diſtemper had been grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long upon him. He was become ſo Corpulent, that he could not go up and down Stairs, but made uſe of an Ingine,
<note place="margin">The King's Sickneſs.</note> when he intended to walk in his Garden, by which he was let down and drawn up. He had an old Sore in his Leg, that pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him much, the Humours of his Body diſcharging themſelves that way, till at laſt all ſetled in a Dropſy. Thoſe about him were afraid to let him know that his Death ſeemed near, leſt that might have been brought within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of foretelling his Death, which was made Treaſon. His Will was made ready, and as it was given out, was ſigned by him on the 30th of <hi>December.</hi> He had made one at his laſt going over to <hi>France.</hi> All the Change that he made at this time was, that he ordered <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s Name to be ſtruck out, for in that formerly made, he was named one of the Executors. When Sir <hi>Anthony Brown</hi> endeavoured to perſwade him not to put that Diſgrace on an old Servant, he continued poſitive in it; for he ſaid, he knew his Temper, and could govern him; but it would not be in the Power of others to do it, if he were put in ſo high a Truſt. The moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial thing in the Will, was, the preferring the Children of his ſecond Siſter, by <hi>Charles Brandon,</hi> to the Children of his eldeſt Siſter the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Succeſſion to the Crown. Some Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:170737:171"/>were made to the Validity and Truth of the Will. It was not ſigned by the King's Hand, as it was directed by the Act of Parliament, but only ſtamped with his Name; and it was ſaid, this was done when he was dying, without any Order given for it by himſelf; for proof of which, the <hi>Scots</hi> that were moſt concerned, appealed to many Witneſſes; and chiefly, to a Depoſition which the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> had made, who was then Secretary of State. On his Death-bed he finiſhed the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Trinity-Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and of Chriſt's-Church Hoſpital near <hi>Newgate;</hi> yet this laſt was not ſo fully ſetled as was needful, till his Son compleated what he had begun.</p>
               <p>On the 27th of <hi>January,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And Death.</note> his Spirits ſunk ſo, that it was viſible he had not long to live. Sir <hi>Anthony Denny</hi> took the courage to tell him, that Death was approaching, and deſired him to call on God for his Mercy. The King expreſt in general his Sorrow for his paſt Sins, and his Truſt in the Mercies of God in Chriſt Jeſus. He ordered <hi>Cranmer</hi> to be ſent for, but he was ſpeechleſs before he could be brought from <hi>Croidon;</hi> yet he gave a Sign that he underſtood what he ſaid to him, and ſoon after, he died, in the 57th Year of his Age, after he had reigned 37 Years, and nine Months. His Death was concealed three days, for the Parliament which was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved with his laſt Breath, continued to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:170737:171"/>do buſineſs till the 31ſt, and then his Death was publiſhed. It is probable the <hi>Seimours</hi> concealed it ſo long, till they made a Party for the putting the Government into their own Hands.</p>
               <p>The Severities he uſed againſt many of his Subjects in matters of Religion,
<note place="margin">An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Severities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prieſts.</note> made both ſides write with great Sharpneſs of him: His Temper was Imperious and Cruel: He was both ſudden and violent in his Revenges, and ſtuck at nothing by which he could either gratify his Luſt, or his Paſſion. This was much provoked, by the Sentence the Pope thundered againſt him, by the virulent Books Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> and others publiſhed, by the Rebellions that were raiſed in <hi>England,</hi> and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions he was in of the Emperour's Greatneſs, and of the Inclinations his People had to have joined with him, together with what he had read in Hiſtory of the Fates of thoſe Princes, againſt whom Popes had thundered in former times; all which, made him think it neceſſary to keep his People under the Terror of a ſevere Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and by ſome publick Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to ſecure the Peace of the Nation; and thereby to prevent a more profuſe Effuſion of Blood, which might have otherwiſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed if he had been more gentle. And it was no wonder if after the Pope depoſed him, he proceeded to great Severities againſt all that which ſupported that Authority.</p>

               <p>The firſt Inſtance of Capital Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings upon that account, was in <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Term, 1535, in which, three Priors and a Monk of the Carthuſian Order,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſians <hi>in particular.</hi>
                  </note> were condemned of Treaſon, for ſaying, that the King was not Supream Head of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> It was then only a <hi>Premunire,</hi> not to ſwear to the Supremacy, but it was made Treaſon to deny it, or ſpeak againſt it. <hi>Hall,</hi> a Secular Prieſt, was at the ſame time condemned of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <q rend="inline">for calling the King a Tyrant, an Heretick, a Robber, and an Adulterer; and ſaying, that he would die as King <hi>John,</hi> or <hi>Richard</hi> the Third died; and that it would never be well with the Church till the King was brought to Pot: And that they looked when <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> would riſe; and were aſſured that three parts of four in <hi>England</hi> would join with them.</q> All theſe pleaded <hi>not Guilty;</hi> but being condemned, they juſtified what they had ſaid. The <hi>Carthuſians</hi> were hanged in their Habits. Soon after that, three <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſians</hi> were condemned, and executed at <hi>London,</hi> &amp; two more at <hi>York,</hi> upon the ſame account, for oppoſing the King's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy. Ten other Monks were ſhut up in their Cells, of whom nine died there, and one was condemned, and hanged. Theſe had been all Complices in the Buſineſs of the Maid of <hi>Kent;</hi> and tho that was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, yet it gave the Government ground to have a watchful Eye over them, and to
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:170737:172"/>proceed more ſeverly againſt them upon the firſt Provocation,</p>
               <p>After theſe,
<note place="margin">Fiſher's <hi>Sufferings.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Fiſher</hi> and <hi>More</hi> were brought to their Trials; Pope <hi>Clements</hi> officious Kindneſs to <hi>Fiſher</hi> in declaring him a Cardinal, did haſten his Ruine, tho he was little concerned at that Honour that was done him. He was tried by a Jury of Commoners, and was found guilty of Treaſon, for having ſpoken againſt the King's Supremacy: but inſtead of the Common Death in Caſes of Treaſon, the King ordered him to be beheaded. On the 22th of <hi>June</hi> he ſuffered. He dreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with more then ordinary Care that day; for he ſaid it was to be his Wedding-Day. As he was led out, he opened the New Teſtament at a Venture, and prayed, that ſuch a place might turn up as might comfort him in his laſt Moments. The Words on which he caſt his Eyes were, <hi>This is Life Eternal to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> So he ſhut the Book, and continued meditating on theſe Words to the laſt. On the Scaffold he repeated the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and ſo laid his Head on the Block, which was ſevered from his Body. He was a learned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Man, but much addicted to Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and too cruel in his Temper againſt Hereticks. He had been Confeſſor to the King's Grand-Mother, and perſwaded her to found two Colledges in <hi>Cambridge, Chriſt</hi>'s and St <hi>John</hi>'s; in Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:170737:173"/>of which,

He was much eſteemed by this King, till the Suit of the Divorce was ſet on foot; and then he adhered ſtifly to the Marriage, and the Popes Supremacy; and that made him too favourable to the Nun of <hi>Kent.</hi> But the Severities of his long Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, together with this bloody Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, were univerſally condemned all the World over; only <hi>Gardiner</hi> imploied his Servile Pen to write a Vindication of the King's Proceedings againſt him. It was writ in Elegant Latin, but the Stile was thought too Vehement.

               <p>It was harder to find matter againſt Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> for he was very cautious, and ſatisfied his own Conſcience by not ſwearing the Supremacy, but would not not ſpeak againſt it. <q rend="inline">He ſaid the Act had two Edges, if he conſented to it, it would damne his Soul; and if he ſpoke againſt it, it would condemn his Body. This was all the Meſſage he ſent to <hi>Fiſher,</hi> when he deſired to know his Opinion about it; he had alſo ſaid the ſame to the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> and ſome Counſellors that came to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine him. And <hi>Rich,</hi> then the King's Solicitor, coming as a private Friend, to perſwade him to ſwear the Oath, urged
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:170737:173"/>him with the Act of Parliament, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, if he ſhould be made King by Act of Parliament, would not he Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him: He anſwered, he would; becauſe a King might be made, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived by a Parliament. But the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Supremacy was a point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to which the Parliament's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority did not extend it ſelf.</q> All this <hi>Rich</hi> witneſſed againſt him; ſo theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars were laid together, as amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Denial of the King's Supremacy, and upon this he was judged guilty of Treaſon. He received his Sentence with that equal Temper of Mind which he had ſhewed in both Conditions of Life. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed great Contempt of the World, and much Wearineſs in living in it. His ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Facetiouſneſs remained with him to his laſt Moment on the Scaffold. Some cenſured that as affected and indecent, and as having more of the Stoick than the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in it. But others ſaid, that way of Railery had been ſo Cuſtomary to him, that Death did not diſcompoſe him, nor put him out of his ordinary Humour. He was beheaded on the 6th of <hi>July,</hi> in the 52d or 53d Year of his Age. He had great Capacities, and eminent Vertues. In his Youth he had freer thoughts, but he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards much corrupted by Superſtition, and became fierce for all the Intereſts of the Clergy. He wrote much in Defence of all the old Abuſes. His Learning in Divinity was
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170737:174"/>but ordinary; for he had read little more than ſome of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Treatiſes, and the Canon Law, and the Maſter of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, beyond whom, his Quotations do ſeldom go. His Stile was Natural and Pleaſant; and he could turn things very dextrouſly to make them look well or ill as it ſerved his Purpoſe. But tho he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for denying the Kings Supremacy, yet he was at firſt no Zealot for the Pope: <q rend="inline">For he ſays of himſelf, That when the King ſhewed him his Book in Manuſcript, which he wrote againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> he adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to leave out that which he had put in it concerning the Pope's Power, for he did not know what Quarrels he might have afterwards with the Pope's, and then that would be turned againſt him.</q> But the King was perhaps fond of what he had written, and ſo he would not follow that wiſe Advice which he gave him.</p>
               <p>There were no Executions after this,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1537"/> till the Rebellions of <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> and <hi>Yorkshire</hi> gave new Occaſions to Severity;

They had not only been in the Rebellion, but had forfeited the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pardon, by their new Attempts, after it was proclaimed: Yet ſome ſaid, the King took Advantage on very ſlight Grounds to break his Indemnity. But on the other
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:170737:174"/>hand, it was no Wonder if he proceeded with the utmoſt Rigour againſt thoſe who had raiſed ſuch a Storm in the Kingdom, and in particular againſt thoſe Abbots and Monks who had ſworn to maintain his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and yet were the chief Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that had ſet the Kingdom on Fire.</p>

It was alſo found, that in ſecret Confeſſion, he had alienated many from the King's Supremacy; and being queſtioned for it, he ſaid, he had taken the Oath <hi>for it only with his outward Man, but his inward Man had never conſented to it.</hi> But he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to recant and abjure this Opinion; yet being afterwards diverted from that, he was condemned as an Heretick, and was burnt in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> A Pardon was offered him at the Stake, if he would recant; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it.

               <p>After theſe Judgments and Executions were over, a new and unheard of Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was made, of Attainting ſome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bringing them to make their Anſwers,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:170737:175"/>which is a Blemiſh on this Reign, that can never be waſhed off, and was a Breach of the moſt ſacred and unalterable Rules of Juſtice. The firſt that were ſo condemned were, the Marchioneſs of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the Counteſs of <hi>Sarum,</hi> Mother to Card. <hi>Pool.</hi> The ſpecial Matter charged on the former, was, her Confederating her ſelf with Sir <hi>Nicholas Carew;</hi> and that againſt the other was, the Confederating with her Son, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Pool.</hi> No Witneſſes were examined to prove theſe things againſt them; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome Depoſitions might have been read in Parliament. <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſhewed a Coat which was found among the Counteſs of <hi>Sarum</hi>'s Cloaths, on which the Standard uſed by the <hi>Yorkshire</hi> Rebels was wrought; from which it was inferred, that ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of them. Fourteen others were At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted by the ſame Act: ſix of them were Prieſts, one was a Knight Hoſpitaller, four were Gentlemen, one was a Merchant, and two were Yeomen; all were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Confederating with the Pope or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Pool;</hi> or aſſerting the Pope's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; or endeavouring to raiſe Rebellion: But againſt four of them, there is nothing but Treaſon in General Words alledged. This Bill was paſt in two days by the Lords, and in five by the Commons: But of all theſe, only three were executed, theſe were the Counteſs of <hi>Sarum;</hi> tho not till two Years after this; and Sir <hi>Adrian For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſcue,</hi> and <hi>Dingley,</hi> the Knight of St. <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:170737:176"/>of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> In the Counteſs of <hi>Sarum</hi> did the Name of <hi>Plantagenet</hi> end: She was about 70 Years old, but ſhewed that in that Age ſhe had a Vigorous and Maſculine Mind.</p>
               <p>In the Parliament that ſate in the Year 1540, ſeveral others were Attainted in the ſame manner, without being heard, and for the ſame Crimes. <hi>Fetherſton, Abel,</hi> and <hi>Powel,</hi> and ſix more, were ſo condemned; but thoſe three only ſuffered. By another Act of the ſame Parliament, the Lord <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerford,</hi> and his Chaplain, <hi>Bird,</hi> were At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted: His Chaplain had often Perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to rebel; and had ſaid, that the King was the greateſt Heretick in the World. <hi>Hungerford</hi> had alſo ordered ſome of his other Chaplains to uſe Conjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they might know how long the King would live, and whether he would be Victorious over his Enemies. He was alſo charged for having lived in Sodomy with ſeveral of his Servants, three Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He was ſoon after executed, and died in great diſorder.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1541, Five Prieſts, and ten Laymen, were ſtirring up the People in the North to a new Rebellion; but it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and they ſuffered for it. In the Year 1543, <hi>Gardiner</hi> that was the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>'s Secretary, and three other Prieſts, were condemned, and executed, for denying the King's Supremacy: and this was the laſt Occaſion that was given to the King to ſhew his Severity on that account.
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170737:176"/>In all theſe Executions it cannot be denied but the Laws were exceſſively ſevere, and the Proceedings upon them were never tempered with that Mildneſs which ought to be often applied for the mitigating the rigour of Penal Laws: But tho they are much aggravated by Popiſh Writers; they were far ſhort of the Cruelties uſed in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign.</p>
               <p>To conclude, We have now gone through the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, who is rather to be reckoned among the Great, than the Good Princes. He exerciſed ſo much Severity on Men of both Perſwaſions, that the Writers of both ſides have laid open his Faults, and taxed his Cruelty. But as neither of them were much obliged to him; ſo none have taken ſo much care to ſet forth his good Qualities, as his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have done to enlarge on his Vices. I do not deny that he is to be numbered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>ill</hi> Princes, yet I cannot rank him with the <hi>worſt.</hi>

At ſix years of Age he was put into the hands of Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cheek,</hi> the one was to form his mind, and to teach him Philoſophy and Divinity, the other was to teach him the Tongues and Mathematicks: other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were alſo appointed for the other parts of his Education. He diſcovered ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry early a good diſpoſition to Religion and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170737:178"/>Vertue, and a particular Reverence for the Scriptures: for he took it very ill when one about him laid a great Bible on the Floor, to ſtep up on it to ſomewhat which was out of his reach, without ſuch an advantage. He profited well in Letters, and wrote at eight Years old Latin Letters frequently both to the King, to Q. <hi>Katherine Parre,</hi> to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and his Uncle the Earl of <hi>Hartford,</hi> who had been firſt made Viſcount <hi>Beauchamp,</hi> being the Heir by his Mother of that Family, and was after that advanced to be an Earl.</p>
               <p>In the end of his Fathers life, it had been deſigned to create him Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi> for that was one of the reaſons given to haſten the attainder of the D. of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> becauſe he held ſome places during life, which the King intended to put in other hands, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that Ceremony.

There was alſo a Privy Council named to be their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in the Government; if any of the 16. died, the Survivers were to continue in the Adminiſtration, without a power to ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute others in their rooms who ſhould die. It was now propoſed that one ſhould be choſen out of the 16. to whom Ambaſſadours ſhould addreſs themſelves, and who ſhould have the chief direction of affairs; but ſhould be reſtrained to do nothing but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the greater part of the other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>executors. The Chancellor, who thought the Precedence fell to him by his Office, ſince the Archbiſhop did not meddle much in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Affairs, oppoſed this much, and ſaid it was a change of the Kings will; who had made them all equal in power and dignity; and if any were raiſed above the reſt in Title, it would not be poſſible to keep him within due bounds, ſince great Titles make way for High Power: but the Earl of <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:170737:179"/>had ſo prepared his Friends, that it was carried that he ſhould be declared the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Kings Perſon, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the Kingdom,
<note place="margin">A Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</note> with this reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he ſhould do nothing but by the advice and conſent of the reſt. Upon this advancement, and the oppoſition made to it, two Parties were formed, the one headed by the Protector, and the other by the Chancellour: the favourers of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation were of the former, and thoſe that oppoſed it were of the latter. The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor was ordered to renew the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Judges and Juſtices of Peace, and King <hi>Henry</hi>'s great Seal was to be made uſe of, till a new one ſhould be made. The day after this all the Executors took their Oaths to execute their truſt faithfully, the Privy Councellors were alſo brought into the Kings preſence, who did all expreſs their ſatisfaction in the choice that was made of the Protector: and it was ordered that all diſpatches to foreign Princes ſhould be ſigned only by him. All that held Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were required to come and renew their Commiſſions,
<note place="margin">Biſhops take out Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</note> and to ſwear Allegiance to the King: among the reſt, the Biſhops came and took out ſuch Commiſſions as were granted in the former Reign, only by thoſe they were ſubaltern to the Kings Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but there being none now in that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, they were immediately ſubaltern to the King; and by them they were to hold their Biſhopricks only during the Kings pleaſure, and were impowered in the Kings name, as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170737:179"/>his Delegates, to perform all the parts of the Epiſcopal function. <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſet an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to the reſt in taking out one of thoſe. It was thought fit thus to keep the Biſhops under the terror of ſuch an Arbitrary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er lodged in the King, that ſo it might be more eaſie to turn them out, if they ſhould much oppoſe what might be done in points of Religion: but the ill conſequences of ſuch an unlimited power being well fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, the Biſhops that were afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted were not ſo fettered, but were provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to hold their Biſhopricks during life.</p>
               <p>The late King had in his Will required his Executors to perform all the promiſes he had made;
<note place="margin">A Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen.</note> ſo <hi>Paget</hi> was required to give an account of the Promiſes the late King had made; and he declared upon Oath, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the proſpect of the attainder of the D. of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the King intended a Creation of Peers, and to divide his Lands among them; the Perſons to be raiſed, were <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to be a Duke, <hi>Eſſex</hi> a Marqueſs, <hi>Liſle, Ruſſel, St. John,</hi> and <hi>Wriotheſly</hi> to be Earls, Sir <hi>Tho. Seimour, Cheyney, Rich, Willoughby, Arundell, Sheffield, St. Leger, Wymbiſh, Vernon,</hi> and <hi>Danby</hi> to be Barons, and a diviſion was to be made of the Duke of <hi>Norfolks</hi> Eſtate among them: ſome ſhares were alſo ſet off for others, who were not to be advanced in Title, as <hi>Denny</hi> and <hi>Herbert:</hi> and they find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Paget</hi> had been mindful of them, but had not mentioned himſelf, had moved the King for a ſhare to him. The King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Paget</hi> to give notice of this to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170737:180"/>Perſons named: but many excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and deſired no addition of honor, ſince the Lands which the King intended to give them were not ſufficient to ſupport that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> prevented all this, for being apprehenſive of the ruine of his Family, if his Eſtate were once divided, he ſent a meſſage to the King, deſiring him to convert it all to be a Revenue to the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> This wrought ſo much on the King, that he reſolved to reward thoſe he intended to raiſe another way, and he appointed that Eſtate to be kept entire, and the Kings diſtemper increaſing on him, he at laſt came to a reſolution, that the E. of <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> ſhould be made a Duke, &amp; be made both Earl Marſhal and Lord Treaſurer, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> a Marqueſs, <hi>Liſle</hi> and <hi>Wriotheſly</hi> Earls, and <hi>Seimour, Rich, Sheffield, St. Leger, Willoughby</hi> and <hi>Danby</hi> Barons, with Revenues in Lands to every one of them: and the Earl of <hi>Hartford</hi> was to have the firſt good Deanery and Treaſurerſhip, and the four beſt Prebends that ſhould fall in any Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral. But though the King had reſolved on this, and had ordered <hi>Paget</hi> to propoſe it to the Perſons concerned, yet his Diſeaſe increaſed ſo faſt on him, that he never fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it: and therefore he ordered his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors to perform all that ſhould appear to have been promiſed by him. The greateſt part of this was alſo confirmed by <hi>Denny</hi> and <hi>Herbert,</hi> to whom the King had talked of it, and had ſhewed the deſign of it in writing, as it had been agreed between
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170737:180"/>
                  <hi>Paget</hi> and him. So the Executors being concerned in this themſelves, it may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſuppoſed that they determined to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this part of their truſt very faithfully. Yet the King being then like to be engaged in Wars, they reſolved neither to leſſen his Treaſure nor Revenue, but to find another way for giving the Rewards intended by the King, which was afterwards done by the ſale and diſtribution of the Chantry Lands.</p>
               <p>The Caſtle of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> was then much preſſed; ſo they ſent down by <hi>Balnaves,</hi> the Agent of that party, 1180 <hi>l.</hi> for the pay of the Garriſon; they gave alſo penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the chief ſupporters of their Intereſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſome 250, to others 200 <hi>l.</hi> or leſs, according to their intereſt in the Countrey. The King received the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Knighthood from the Protector, and Knighted the Mayor of <hi>London</hi> the ſame day.</p>
               <p>The grant of ſo many Eccleſiaſtical Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to the Earl of <hi>Hartford,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lay-men had Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Dignities.</note> was no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thing at that time, for as <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> had been Dean of <hi>Wells,</hi> ſo diverſe other Lay-men were provided to them; which was thus excuſed, becauſe there was no cure of Souls belonging to them; and during vacancies, even in times of Popery, the Kings had by their own Authority, by the Right of the <hi>Regale,</hi> given Inſtitution to them, ſo that they ſeem'd to be no Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual imployments, and the Eccleſiaſticks that had enjoyed them, had been a lazy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170737:181"/>and ſenſual ſort of men, ſo that their abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe Revenues, either to luxury, or to the enriching their kindred by the ſpoils of the Church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1547"/> had this effect that the putting them in Lay hands gave no great ſcandal; and that the rather, becauſe a ſimple tonſure qualified a man for them by the Canons. Theſe foundations were at firſt deſigned for a Nurſery to the Dioceſs, in which the young Clergy were to be educated, or for a retreat to thoſe who were more ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and not ſo fit for the ſervice of the Church in the active parts of the Paſtoral care; ſo it had been an excellent deſign to have reformed them, and reſtored them to the purpoſes for which they were at firſt intended: And it was both againſt <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all Natural Equity, to take them out of the hands of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and give them to thoſe of the Laity. But it was no wonder to ſee men yet under the influence of the Canon Law, commit ſuch errors.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time an accident fell out,
<note place="margin">Some take down I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</note> that made way for great changes; the Curate and Church-wardens of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> were brought before the Council for removing the Crucifix, and other Images, and putting ſome Texts of Scripture on the Walls of their Church, in the places where they ſtood: They Anſwered, That they going to repair their Church, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Images, and they being rotten, they did not renew them, but put places of Scripture in their room: They had alſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170737:181"/>removed others, which they found had been abuſed to Idolatry. Great pains was taken by the Popiſh party to puniſh them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, for ſtriking terrour into others; but <hi>Cranmer</hi> was for the removing of all Images which were ſet up in Churches, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly contrary both to the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and to the practice of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for diverſe ages:
<note place="margin" type="runSum">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for and againſt it.</note> And though in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the groſs abuſes of Paganiſm there was very early much of the Pomp of their worſhip brought into the Chriſtian Church, yet it was long before this crept in. At firſt all Images were condemned by the Fathers: then they allowed the uſe of them, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the worſhipping of them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the Eighth and Ninth Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the worſhipping of them was, after a long conteſt, both in the Eaſt and Weſt, in which there were, by turns, General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, that both approved and condemned them, at laſt generally received, and then the reverence for them, and for ſome in particular, that were believed to be more wonderfully enchanted, was much impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the cheats of the Monks, who had enriched themſelves by ſuch means: And it was grown to ſuch a height, that Heatheniſm it ſelf had been guilty of nothing more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd towards its Idols; and the ſingular vertues in ſome Images, ſhewed they were not worſhipp'd only as Repreſentations, for then all ſhould have equal degrees of veneration paid to them. And ſince all theſe abuſes had riſen meerly out of the bare
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170737:182"/>uſe of them, and the ſetting them up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the command of God, and the nature of the Chriſtian Religion, which is ſimple and Spiritual; it ſeemed moſt reaſonable to cure the diſeaſe in its root, and to clear the Churches of Images, that ſo the people might be preſerved from Idolatry. Theſe Reaſons prevail'd ſo far, that the Curate and Wardens were diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a Reprimand; they were required to beware of ſuch raſhneſs for the future, and to provide a Crucifix, and till that could be had, they were ordered to cauſe one to be painted on the Wall. Upon this, Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> being to preach before the King, inveighed againſt the ſuperſtition towards Images and Holy Water, and there was a general diſpoſition over all the Nation to pull them down; which was ſoon after ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> Upon that, <hi>Gardiner</hi> made great complaints, he ſaid the <hi>Lutherans</hi> themſelves went not ſo far, for he had ſeen Images in their Churches; he argued from the Kings face on the Coyn and Great Seal for the uſe of Images, and that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> did no more bind in this particular, than in that of abſtaining from Blood: He diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed between Image and Idol, as if the one, which he ſaid was only condemned, was the repreſentation of a Falſe God, and the other of the True; and he thought, that as words conveyed by the Ear begat devotion, ſo Images, by the conveyance of the Eye, might have the ſame effect on the mind: He alſo thought, a vertue might
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170737:182"/>be both in them and in Holy Water, as well as there was in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Garments, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Shadow, or <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Staffe: And there might be a Vertue in Holy Water, as well as in the Water of Baptiſm. He alſo menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the Vertue that was in the Cramp-Rings, bleſſed by the late King, which he had known to be much eſteemed and ſought after, and he hoped their young King would not neglect that gift. But to theſe things which <hi>Gardiner</hi> wrote in ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Protector, perhaps by <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s direction, wrote anſwer, that the Biſhops had formerly argued much in another ſtrain, that becauſe the Scriptures were abuſed by the vulgar Readers, therefore they were not to be truſted to them; and ſo made a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended abuſe, the ground of taking away that, which by Gods ſpecial appointment was to be delivered to all Chriſtians: This did hold much ſtronger againſt Images that were forbidden by God. The Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſet up by <hi>Moſes,</hi> by Gods own dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, was broken when abuſed to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for that was the greateſt corruption of Religion poſſible: And the Civil reſpect payed to the Kings Image on a Seal, or on the Coyn, did not juſtifie the dotage upon I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages. But yet the Protector acknowledged he had reaſon to complain of the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the people, that broke down Images without authority. This was the firſt ſtep that was made in this Reign, towards a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, of which the ſequel ſhall appear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. Orders were ſent to the Juſtices of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170737:183"/>the Peace, to look well to the Peace and Government of the Nation, to meet often, and every ſix weeks to advertiſe the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the ſtate of the County to which they belonged.</p>
               <p>The Funerals of the deceaſed King were performed with the ordinary Ceremonies at <hi>Windſor:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Kings Funeral.</note> One thing gave thoſe that hated him ſome advantages; his Body was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the firſt day to <hi>Sheen,</hi> which had been a Nunnery, and there ſome of the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and fat dropt through the Coffin; and to make it a compleat accompliſhment of <hi>Peyto</hi>'s denunciation, that <hi>Dogs ſhould lick his Blood,</hi> it was ſaid the Dogs next day licked it. This in a Corpulent man was ſo far from a wonder, that it had been a wonder if it had been otherwiſe, and was a certain ſign of nothing but the Plummers careleſneſs, and their weakneſs and malice that made ſuch Inferences from it. The King left ſix hundred pounds a year to the Church of <hi>Windſor,</hi> for Prieſts to ſay Maſs for his Soul every day, and for four Obits a year, and Sermons, and diſtribution of Alms at every one of them, and for a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon every <hi>Sunday,</hi> and a maintenance for thirteen poor Knights, which was ſetled upon that Church by his Executors in due form of Law.</p>
               <p>The Pomp of this Endowment now in a more Inquiſitive Age led people to examine the uſefulneſs of Soul Maſſes and Obits.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170737:183"/>but it was not eaſie to conceive how that was to be applied to departed Souls. For all the good that they could receive, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only applicable to the prayers for them; but bare Prayers would not have wrought ſo much on the people, nor would they have payed ſo dear for them. It was a clear project for drawing in the wealth of the World into their hands. In the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church there was a Commemoration of the Dead, or an Honourable Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them made in the daily Offices, and for ſome very ſmall faults their names were not mentioned, which would not have had done if they had looked upon that as a thing that was really a relief to them in another ſtate. But even this cuſtome grew to be abuſed, and ſome inferred from it, that departed Souls, unleſs they were ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally pure, paſſed through a Purgation in the next life, before they were admitted to Heaven: Of which St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in whoſe time the opinion was beginning to be received, ſays, that it was taken up without any ſure ground in Scripture. But what was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Scripture proof was ſupplied by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Dreams and Tales, till it was generally received. King <hi>Henry</hi> had acted like one that did not much believe it, for he was to expect no good uſage in Purgatory, from thoſe Souls whom he had deprived of the Maſſes that were ſaid for them in Monaſteries, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying thoſe Foundations. Yet it ſeems he intended to make ſure work for himſelf, ſo that if Maſſes could avail the departed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170737:184"/>Souls, he reſolved to have his ſhare of it; and as he gratified the Prieſts by this part of his Endowment, ſo he pleaſed the people by appointing Sermons and Alms to be given on ſuch days. Thus he died as he had lived, ſwimming between both perſwaſions. And it occaſioned no ſmall debate, when men ſought to find out what his opinions were in the controverted points of Religion: For the eſteem he was in made both ſides ſtudy to juſtifie themſelves, by ſeeming to follow his ſentiments; the one party ſaid he was reſolved never to alter Religion, but only to cut off ſome abuſes, and intended to go no further than he had gone: They did therefore vehemently preſs the others to innovate nothing, but to keep things in the ſtate in which he left them, till his Son ſhould come of Age: But the oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſaid, that he had reſolved to go a great way further, and particularly to turn the Maſs to a Communion; and therefore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion being of ſuch conſequence to the Salvation of Souls, it was neceſſary to make all the haſte in Reformation that was fitting and decent.
<note place="margin">The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation.</note> But now the diverſions of the Coronation took them off from more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts: The Protector was made Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Northampton,</hi> the Lords <hi>Liſle</hi> and <hi>Wriotheſley</hi> Earls of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Southampton, Seimour, Rich, Willoughby</hi> and <hi>Sheffield,</hi> were made Barons. In order to the Kings Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Office for that Ceremony was reviewed, and much ſhortned: One remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170737:184"/>alteration was, that formerly the King uſed to be preſented to the people at the corners of the Scaffold, and they were asked, If they would have him to be their King? Which looked like a rite of an Election, rather than a Ceremony of Inveſting one that was already King. This was now changed, and the people were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired only to give their aſſents and good will to his Coronation, as by the duty of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they were bound to do. On the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>February</hi> he was Crowned, and a General Pardon was proclaimed, out of which the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> and ſome others were excepted.</p>
               <p>The Chancellour,
<note place="margin">The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour turned out.</note> who was lookt on as the head of the Popiſh party, gave now an advantage againſt himſelf, which was very readily laid hold on. He granted a Commiſſion to the Maſter of the Rolls and three Maſters of Chancery, of whom two were Civilians, to execute his Office in the Court of Chancery, as if he were preſent, only their Decrees were to be brought to him to be Signed, before they ſhould be Inrolled. This being done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any authority from the Protector, and the other Executors, was thought a high Preſumption, ſince he did hereby devolve on others that truſt which was depoſited in his hands. Upon this, ſome Lawyers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the Protector, and they ſeem'd alſo apprehenſive of a deſign to change the Common Laws, which was occaſioned by the Decrees made by the Civilians, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170737:185"/>were more ſuted to the Imperial, than to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws. The Judges being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to give their opinions, made report, That what the Chancellour had done was againſt Law, and that he had forfeited his place, and might be impriſoned for it du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pleaſure. But he carried it high, he threatned both the Judges and Lawyers; and when it was urged that he had forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his place, he ſaid he had it from the late King, who had likewiſe named him one of the Executors, during his Sons minority. But it was anſwered, That the major part had power over any of the reſt, otherwiſe one of them might rebel, and pretend he could not be puniſhed by the reſt. He being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of that, was more humble, and acknowledged he had no Warrant for granting the Commiſſion, he thought by his Office he might lawfully do it, he asked Pardon for his offence, and deſired he might loſe his place with as little diſgrace as was poſſible; and then it was reſolved on by the reſt to take the Seal from him, and to Fine him as they ſhould afterwards think fit. So he being ſuffered to go home with the Seal, the Lord <hi>Seimour,</hi> and ſome others were ſent to demand it of him: He was alſo confined to his houſe, and kept under the terrour of an Arbitrary Fine. But upon giving a Bond of 4000 <hi>l.</hi> to be payed upon demand, he was freed from his confinement: Yet he was not put out of the truſt of the King and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for it ſeems the Council did
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170737:185"/>not look on that as a thing that was in their power to do.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, the Protector took a Patent for his Office under the Great Seal,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>March.</hi> Protectors Patent.</note> then in the keeping of the Lord <hi>St. John;</hi> by which he was confirmed in his Authority, till the King ſhould be eighteen years of Age; he was alſo authorized to bring in new Councellours, beſides thoſe enumerated in the Patent, who are both the Executors and the Councellours nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the late King: The Protector, with ſo many of the Council as he thought meet, were empowered to adminiſter the affairs of the Kingdom; but the Council was limited to do nothing without his Advice and Conſent. And thus was he now as well eſtabliſhed in his Authority as Law could make him. He had a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative on the Council, but they had none on him; and he could either bring his own creatures into it, or ſelect a Cabinet Council out of it as he pleaſed: And the other Executors having now delivered up their Authority to him, were only Privy Councellors as the reſt were, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any ſingular authority peculiar to them, as was provided by King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Will.</p>
               <p>The firſt buſineſs of conſequence that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired great conſideration,
<note place="margin">The affairs of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
                  </note> was the <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caldick.</hi> War, then begun between the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and the Princes of that League; the effects of which, if the Emperor prevailed, were like to be, not only the extirpating of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170737:186"/>
                  <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> but his being the abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Germany;</hi> which the Emperor chiefly deſigned, in order to an Univerſal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, but diſguiſed it to other Princes: to the <hi>Pope,</hi> he pretended that his deſign was only to extirpate Hereſie; to other Princes, he pretended it was only to repreſs ſome Rebels, and denied all deſign of ſuppreſſing their new Doctrines; which he managed ſo artificially, that he divided <hi>Germany</hi> it ſelf, and got ſome <hi>Lutheran</hi> Princes to declare for him, and others to be Neutrals: and having obtained a very liberal ſupply for his Wars with <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Turk,</hi> for which he granted an Edict for liberty of Religion, he made Peace with both thoſe Princes, and reſolved to imploy that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which the <hi>Germans</hi> had given him, againſt themſelves. That he might deprive them of their chief Allies, he uſed means to engage King <hi>Henry,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt in a War, but that was, chiefly by their Interpoſition, compoſed. And now when the War was like to be carried on with great Vigour, they loſt both thoſe Princes; for as <hi>Henry</hi> died in <hi>January,</hi> ſo <hi>Francis</hi> followed him into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, in <hi>March</hi> following. Many of their Confederates began to capitulate and forſake them; and the divided command of the Duke of <hi>Saxe,</hi> and the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe</hi> loſt them great advantages, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer year; in which it had been eaſie to have driven the Emperor out of <hi>Germany:</hi> but it fell often out, that when the one was for engaging, the other was againſt it, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170737:186"/>made many very doubtful of their ſucceſs. The <hi>Pope</hi> had a mind to engage the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in a War in <hi>Germany,</hi> that ſo <hi>Italy</hi> might be at quiet: and in order to that, and to Imbroil the Emperor with all the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> he publiſhed his Treaty with him, that ſo it might appear that the deſign of the War was to extirpate Hereſie; though the Emperor was making great proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the contrary in <hi>Germany.</hi> He alſo opened the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which the Emperor had long deſired in vain; but it was now brought upon him, when he leaſt wiſhed for it: for the Proteſtants did all declare, that they could not look upon it as a free General Council,
<note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </note> ſince it was ſo entirely at the <hi>Popes</hi> devotion, that not ſo much as a Reformation of ſome of the groſſeſt abuſes that could not be juſtified, was like to be obtained, unleſs clogged with ſuch Clauſes as made it ineffectual. Nor could the Emperor prevail with the Council, not to proceed to eſtabliſh the doctrine, and condemn Hereſie; but the more he obſtructed that by delays, the more did the <hi>Pope</hi> drive it on, to open the eyes of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and engage them all vigorouſly againſt the Emperor: yet he gave them ſuch ſecret aſſurances of tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confeſſion, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> declared for him, and that, joyned with the hopes of the <hi>Electorate,</hi> drew in <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Saxe.</hi> The Count <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> was old and feeble, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Colen</hi> would not make reſiſtance, but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170737:187"/>retired, being condemned both by <hi>Pope</hi> and Emperor, and many of the Cities ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And <hi>Maurice</hi> by falling into <hi>Saxe,</hi> forced the Elector to ſeparate from the Landgrave, and return to the defence of his own Dominions. This was the ſtate of the affairs in <hi>Germany:</hi> ſo it was a hard point to reſolve on, what anſwer the Protector ſhould give to the Duke of <hi>Saxe</hi>'s Chancellor, whom he ſent over to obtain an Aid in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for carrying on the War. It was on the one hand of great importance to the ſafety of <hi>England</hi> to preſerve the <hi>German</hi> Princes, and yet it was very dangerous to begin a War of ſuch Conſequence under an Infant King. At preſent they promiſed, within three Months, to ſend by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of the Still-yard 50000 Crowns to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and reſolved to do no more till new Emergents ſhould lead them to new Councels.</p>
               <p>The Nation was in an ill condition for a War,
<note place="margin">Diviſions in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> with ſuch a mighty Prince, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under great diſtractions at home, the People generally cried out for a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they deſpiſed the Clergy, and loved the new Preachers. The Prieſts were for the moſt part both very ignorant and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous in their lives: many of them had been Monks, and thoſe that were to pay them the penſions, that were reſerved to them at the deſtruction of the Monaſteries, till they ſhould be provided, took care to get them into ſome ſmall Benefice. The greateſt part of the Parſonages were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170737:187"/>for they belonged to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, and the Abbots had only granted the Incumbents, either the Vicarage, or ſome ſmall Donative, and left them the Perquiſites raiſed by Maſſes and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. At the ſuppreſſion of thoſe Houſes there was no care taken to provide the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents better; ſo they chiefly ſubſiſted by Trentals &amp; other Devices, that brought them in ſome ſmall relief, though the Price of them was ſcandalouſly low, for Maſſes went often at 2 <hi>d.</hi> a Groat was a great bounty. Now theſe ſaw that a Reformation of thoſe abuſes, took the Bread out of their mouths; ſo their Intereſts prevailing more with them than any thing elſe, they were zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly engaged againſt all changes: but that ſame Principle made them comply with every change that was made, rather than loſe their Benefices: Their poverty made them run into another abuſe of holding more Benefices at the ſame time, a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of ſo crying and ſcandalous a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that where ever it is practiſed, it is ſufficient to poſſeſs the People with great prejudices againſt the Church that is guilty of it: there being nothing more contrary to the plaineſt impreſſions of reaſon, than that every Man who undertakes a Cure of Souls, whom at his Ordination he has vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he would inſtruct, feed, govern, ought to diſcharge that truſt himſelf, which is the greateſt and moſt important of all others. The Clergy were incouraged in their Oppoſition to all changes, by the protection
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170737:188"/>they expected from <hi>Gardiner, Bonner,</hi> and <hi>Tonſtall,</hi> who were Men of great reputation, as well as ſet in high places: and above all, Lady <hi>Mary</hi> did openly declare againſt all Changes, till the King ſhould be of Age. But on the other hand, <hi>Cranmer,</hi> whoſe greateſt weakneſs was his over-obſequiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to King <hi>Henry,</hi> being now at liberty, reſolved to proceed more vigorouſly: The Protector was firmly united to him, ſo were the young Kings Tutors, and he was as much engaged, as could be expected from ſo young a Perſon: for both his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and zeal for true Religion were above his Age. Several of the Biſhops did alſo declare for a Reformation, but Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> now made Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> was the Perſon on whom he depended moſt. <hi>Latimer</hi> was kept by him at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and did great ſervice by his Sermons, which were very popular, but he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Biſhoprick, chooſing rather to ſerve the Church in a more diſengaged manner. Many of the Biſhops were very ignorant, and poor ſpirited Men, raiſed meerly by Court-favour, who wee little concerned for any thing but their Revenues. <hi>Cranmer</hi> reſolved to proceed by degrees, and to open the reaſons of every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, that was made ſo fully, that he hoped by the bleſſing of God to poſſeſs the Nation of the fitneſs of what they ſhould do, and thereby to prevent any dangerous oppoſition, that might otherwiſe be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:170737:188"/>
               <p>The power of the Privy Council had been much exalted in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s time, by Act of Parliament; and one Proviſo in it was, that the King's Council ſhould have the ſame Authority when he was under Age, that he himſelf had at full Age:
<note place="margin">A Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> ſo it was reſolved to begin with a General Viſitation of all <hi>England,</hi> which was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſix Precincts: and two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, a Civilian, a Divine, and a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter were appointed for every one of theſe. But before they were ſent out,
<note place="margin">May.</note> there was a Letter written to all the Biſhops, giving them notice of it, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending their Juriſdiction while it laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and requiring them to preach no where but in their Cathedrals, and that the other Clergy ſhould not preach but in their own Churches, without Licence: by which it was intended to reſtrain ſuch as were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, to their own Pariſhes, and to grant the others Licences to Preach in any Church of <hi>England.</hi> The greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that the Reformers found, was in the want of able and prudent Men, the moſt zealous were too hot and indiſcreet, and the few they had that were Eminent, were to be imployed in <hi>London,</hi> and the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. Therefore they intended to make thoſe as common as was poſſible, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to preach as Itinerants and Viſitors. The only thing by which the People could be univerſally inſtructed, was a Book of Homilies; ſo the twelve firſt Homilies in the Book, ſtill known by that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170737:189"/>name, were compiled, in framing w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the chief deſign was to acquaint the People aright with the nature of the Goſpel Covenant, in which there were two extreams equally dangerous: the one was of thoſe who thought the Prieſts had an infallible ſecret of ſaving their ſouls, if they would in all things follow their directions; the other was of thoſe who thought that if they magnified Chriſt much, and depended on his Merits, they could not periſh, which way ſoever they led their lives. So the mean between theſe was obſerved, and the People were taught both to depend on the ſufferings of Chriſt, and alſo to lead their lives according to the rules of the Goſpel, without which they could receive no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by his death. Order was alſo given, that a Bible ſhould be in every Church, which though it was commanded by King <hi>Henry,</hi> yet had not been generally obeyed: and for underſtanding the New Teſtament, <hi>Eraſmus</hi>'s Paraphraſe was put out in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and appointed to be ſet up in every Church. His great reputation and learning, and his dying in the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, made this Book to be preferred to any other, ſince there lay no prejudice to <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> which would have been objected to any other Author. They renewed alſo all the Injunctions made by <hi>Cromwel</hi> in the former Reign, which after his fall were but little looked after, as thoſe for inſtructing the people, for removing Images, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down all other cuſtomes abuſed to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170737:189"/>perſtition; for reading the Scriptures, and ſaying the Litany in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for frequent Sermons and Catechiſing, for the Exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lives of the Clergy, and their labours in viſiting the ſick, and the other parts of their function, ſuch as reconciling differences, and exhorting their people to Charities: and all who gave Livings by Simoniacal bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains, were declared to have forfeited their right of Patronage to the King. A great charge was alſo given for the ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lords Day, which was appointed to be ſpent wholly in the ſervice of GOD; it not being enough to hear Maſs or Mattins in the Morning, and ſpend the reſt of the Day in drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and quarrelling, as was commonly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed; but it ought to be all imployed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the duties of Religion, or in acts of Charity, only in time of Harveſt they were allowed to work on that and other Feſtival days. Direction was alſo given, for the bidding of Prayers, in which the King, as Supreme head, the Queen, and the Kings Siſters, the Protector and Council, and all the Orders of the Kingdom were to be mentioned; they were alſo to pray for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſouls, that at the laſt day, <hi>we with them might reſt both body and ſoul.</hi> There were alſo Injunctions given for the Biſhops, that they ſhould preach four times a year in their Dioceſſes, once in their Cathedral, and thrice in any other Church, unleſs they had a good excuſe to the contrary: that their Chaplains ſhould preach often: and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170737:190"/>that they ſhould give Orders to none, but thoſe that were duly qualified.</p>
               <p>Theſe were variouſly cenſured: The Clergy were only impowered to remove the abuſed Images,
<note place="margin">Cenſures on ths In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions.</note> and the People were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from doing it, but this authority being put in their hands, it was thought they would be ſlow and backward in it. It had been happy for this Church, if all had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed ſince that time, to preſs the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſervation of the Lords Day, without ſtarting needleſs queſtions about the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it, and the obligation of the fourth Commandment; which has occaſioned much diſpute and heat: and when one Party raiſed the obligation of that duty to a pitch that was not practicable, it provoked o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ſlacken it too much: and this produced many ſharp reflections on both ſides, and has concluded in too common a neglect of that day, which inſtead of being ſo great a bond and inſtrument of Religion, as it ought to be, is become generally a day of idleneſs and looſneſs. The Corruptions of Lay Patrons and Simoniacal Prieſts have been often complained of, but no Laws nor Proviſions have ever been able to preſerve the Church from this great miſchief; which can never be removed till Patrons look on their right to nominate one to the charge of Souls, as a truſt for which they are to render a ſevere account to God, and till Prieſts are cured of their aſpiring to that charge, and look on it with dread and great caution. The bidding of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170737:190"/>Prayers had been the cuſtome in time of Popery; for the Preacher after he had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his Text, and ſhewed what was to be the method of his Sermon, deſired the People to joyn with him in a Prayer, for a bleſſing upon it; and told them likewiſe, whom they were to pray for, and then all the People ſaid their Beads in ſilence, and he kneeling down ſaid his, and from that this was called the bidding of the Beads. In this new direction for them, Order was given to repeat always the Kings Title of <hi>Supream Head,</hi> that ſo the People hearing it often mentioned, might grow better accuſtomed to it: but when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a bidding Prayer, an immediate one is come generally to be uſed, that enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Titles ſeems not ſo decent a thing, nor is it now ſo neceſſary as it then was. The prayer for departed ſouls was now moderated, to be a prayer only for the conſummation of their happineſs at the laſt day; whereas in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s time, they prayed that God would grant them the fruition of his preſence, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a Purgatory. The Injunctions to the Biſhops, directing them to give Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with great caution, pointed out that by which only a Church can be preſerved from Errors and Corruptions: for when Biſhops do eaſily upon recommendations or emendicated Titles, confer Orders, as a ſort of favour that is at their diſpoſal, the ill effects of that muſt be fatal to the Church; either by the Corruptions that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170737:191"/>thoſe vicious Prieſts will be guilty of, or by the Scandals which are given to ſome good minds by their means, who are thereby diſguſted at the Church for their ſakes, and ſo are diſpoſed to be eaſily drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Societies that ſeparate from it.</p>
               <p>The War with <hi>Scotland</hi> was now in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation;
<note place="margin">The War with <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> but the Protector being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive that <hi>France</hi> would engage in the quarrel, ſent over Sir <hi>Fr. Brian</hi> to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate with the new King, to deſire a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the laſt Peace, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had broken their Faith with the King, in the matter of the Marriage of their Queen. The <hi>French</hi> King refuſed to confirm the Treaty, till ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ſhould be firſt explained, and ſo he diſowned his Fathers Embaſſadour; and for the <hi>Scots,</hi> he ſaid he could not forſake them, if they were in diſtreſs. The <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> alledged that <hi>Scotland</hi> was ſubject to <hi>England;</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> had no regard to that, and would not ſo much as look on the Records that were offer'd to prove it; and ſaid they would take things as they found them, and not look back to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute of two hundred years old. This made the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Council more fearful of engaging in a War, which by all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, would bring a War on them from <hi>France.</hi> The Caſtle of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> was ſurrendred, and all their Penſioners in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were not able to do them great fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: The <hi>Scots</hi> were now much lifted up; for as <hi>England</hi> was under an Infant
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170737:191"/>King, ſo the Court of <hi>France</hi> was governed by their Queen Dowagers Brothers. The <hi>Scots</hi> began to make Inroads on <hi>England,</hi> and Deſcents on <hi>Ireland.</hi> Commiſſioners were ſent to the Borders to treat on both ſides; and the Protector raiſed a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which he reſolved to command in perſon. But the meeting on the Borders was ſoon broke up, for the <hi>Scots</hi> had no Inſtructions to treat concerning the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ordered to treat of nothing elſe, till that ſhould be firſt agreed to. And the Records that were ſhewed of the Homage done by the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Kings to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had no great effect; for the <hi>Scots</hi> either ſaid they were forged, or forced from ſome weak Princes, or were only Homages for their Lands in <hi>England,</hi> as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> for their Lands there. They alſo ſhewed their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords by which their Anceſtors had aſſerted that they were free and independent of <hi>England.</hi> The Protector left Commiſſions of Lieutenancy to ſome of the Nobility,
<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> and devolved his own power, during his abſence, on the Privy Council, and came to the Borders by the end of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> had abandoned the Paſſes, ſo that he found no difficulty in his March, and the ſmall Forts that were in his way, were ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred upon Summons. When the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to <hi>Falſid,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> engaged with them in Parties, but loſt 1300 men. The two Armies came in view; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170737:192"/>of fifteen thouſand Foot and three thouſand Horſe, and a Fleet under the Command of the Lord <hi>Clinton,</hi> ſailed along by them, as they marched near the Coaſt; the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Army conſiſted of thirty thouſand, and a good train of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery.</p>
               <p>The Protector ſent a Meſſage to the <hi>Scots,</hi> inviting them by all the Arguments that could be invented, to conſent to the Marriage; and if that would not be granted, he deſired engagements from them, that their Queen ſhould be contracted to no other perſon, at leaſt till ſhe came of age, and by the advice of the Eſtates, ſhould chooſe a Husband for herſelf. This the Protector offered to get out of the War upon Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable terms, but the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lords thought this great Condeſcenſion was an effect of fear, and believed the Protector was ſtraitned for want of Proviſions; ſo inſtead of publiſhing this offer, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to fall upon him next day: And ſo all the return that was made, was, That if the Protector would march back without any act of Hoſtility, they would not fall upon him. One went officiouſly with the Trumpeter, and challenged the Protector, in the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi>'s name, to decide the matter by their Valour; but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector ſaid he was to fight no way but at the head of his Army, yet the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> accepted the challenge, but <hi>Huntley</hi> had given no order for it. On the twentieth of <hi>September</hi> the Armies engaged. In the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170737:192"/>beginning of the action, a ſhot from the Ships killed a whole lane of men, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered the High-landers, ſo that they could not be made to keep their Ranks.
<note place="margin">The Battel of <hi>Muſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
                  </note> The Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> charged bravely, but was repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> broke in with ſuch fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the <hi>Scots,</hi> that they threw down their Arms and fled. Fourteen thouſand were killed, fifteen hundred taken Priſoners, among whom was the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> and five hundred Gentlemen. Upon this, the Protector went on and took <hi>Leith,</hi> and ſome Iſlands in the <hi>Frith,</hi> in which he put Garriſons, and left Ships to wait on them; he ſent ſome Ships to the mouth of <hi>Tay</hi> and took a Caſtle <hi>(Broughty)</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that River. If he had followed this blow, and gone forward to <hi>Striveling,</hi> to which the Governour, with the ſmall remainders of his Army, had retired, and where the Queen was, it is probable, in the conſternation in which they were, he might have taken that place, and ſo have made an end of the War. But the party his Brother was making at Court, gave him ſuch an Alarm, that he returned before he had ended his buſineſs: And the <hi>Scots</hi> having ſent a Meſſage deſiring a Treaty, which they did only to gain time, he ordered them to ſend their Commiſſioners to <hi>Berwick,</hi> and ſo marched back: He took in all the Caſtles in <hi>Merch</hi> and <hi>Teviotdale,</hi> and left Garriſons in them, and made the Gentry ſwear to be true to the King, and to promote the Marriage. He entred into
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170737:193"/>
                  <hi>Scotch</hi> ground the ſecond of <hi>September,</hi> and returned to <hi>England</hi> on the twenty ninth, with the loſs only of ſixty men, and brought with him a great deal of Artillery, and many Priſoners: This ſucceſs did raiſe his reputation very high, and if he had now made an end of the War, it had, no doubt, eſtabliſh'd him in his authority. The <hi>Scots</hi> ſent no Commiſſioners to <hi>Berwick,</hi> but inſtead of that, they ſent ſome to <hi>France,</hi> to offer their Queen to the Dauphin, and to caſt themſelves on the protection of that Crown; and ſo the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> whom the Protector left to treat with them, returned back. The Protector, upon this great ſucceſs, ſummoned a Parliament, to get himſelf eſtabliſhed in his power.</p>
               <p>The Viſitors had now ended the Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<note place="margin">The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Viſitation.</note> and all had ſubmitted to them, and great Inferences were made from this, that on the ſame day on which the Images were burnt in <hi>London,</hi> their Army obtained that great Victory in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But all ſides are apt to build much on Providence, when it is favourable to them, and yet they will not allow the Argument when it turns againſt them. <hi>Bonner</hi> at firſt proteſted that he would obey the Injunctions, if they were not contrary to the Laws of God, and the Ordinances of the Church; but being called before the Council, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted that, and asked Pardon; yet for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving terrour to others, he was for ſome time put in Priſon upon it. <hi>Gardiner</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:170737:193"/>wrote to one of the Viſitors, before they came to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> that he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Homilies; and if he muſt either quit his Biſhoprick, or ſin againſt his Conſcience, he reſolved to chuſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: Upon this, he was called before the Council, and required to receive the Book of Homilies; but he excepted to one of them, that taught that Charity did not juſtifie, contrary to the Book ſet out by the late King, confirmed in Parliament: He alſo complained of many things in <hi>Eraſmus</hi>'s Paraphraſe: And being preſſed to declare whether he would obey the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or not, he refuſed to promiſe it, and ſo was ſent to the Fleet. <hi>Cranmer</hi> treated in private with him, and they argued much about Juſtification. <hi>Gardiner</hi> thought the Sacraments juſtified, and that Charity ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified as well as Eaith. <hi>Cranmer</hi> thought that only the merits of Chriſt juſtified, as they were applied by Faith, which could not be without Charity; ſo the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion turned much on a different way of explaining the ſame thing. <hi>Gardiner</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected many things to <hi>Eraſmus</hi>'s Book, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to ſome paſſages contrary to the power of Princes; it was anſwered, That Book was not choſen, as having no faults, but as the beſt they knew for clearing the difficulties in Scripture. <hi>Cranmer</hi> offered to him, that if he would concur with them, he ſhould be brought to be one of the Privy Council; but he did not comply in this ſo readily as he ordinarily did to ſuch
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170737:194"/>offers. Upon the Protectors return, he wrote to him, complaining of the Councils proceedings in his abſence; and after he had given his objections to the Injunctions, he excepted to this, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, and argued from many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, that the Kings authority could not be raiſed ſo high; and that though <hi>Cromwel</hi> and others endeavoured to perſwade the late King, that he might govern as the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours did, and that his Will ought to be his Law; yet he was of another opinion, and thought that it was much better to make the Law the Kings Will. He complained alſo that he was hardly uſed, that he had neither Servants, Phyſicians nor Chaplains, allowed to wait on him; and that though he had a Writ of Summons, he was not ſuffered to come to the Parliament, which he ſaid, might bring a Nullity on all their Proceedings. But he lay in Priſon till the Act of General Pardon paſt in Parliament, ſet him at liberty. Many blamed the ſeverity of theſe proceedings as contrary both to Law and Equity, and ſaid that all people, even thoſe who complained moſt of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, were apt to uſurp it when they were in authority: And ſome thought the delivering the doctrine of Juſtification in ſuch nice terms was not ſutable to the plain ſimplicity of the Chriſtian Religion. Lady <hi>Mary</hi> was ſo alarmed at theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, that ſhe wrote to the Protector, that ſuch changes were contrary to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to her Fathers Memory, and it was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170737:194"/>againſt their duty to the King to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch points, and endanger the publick Peace before he was of Age. To which he wrote anſwer, That her Father had died before he could finiſh the good things he had intended concerning Religion; and had expreſſed his regret both before himſelf and many others, that he left things in ſo unſetled a ſtate; and aſſured her that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be done but what would turn to the Glory of God, and the Kings Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: He imputed her Writing to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of others rather than to her ſelf, and deſired her to conſider the matter bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with an humble Spirit and the aſſiſtance of the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>The Parliament was opened the fourth of <hi>November,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meets.</note> and the Protector was by Patent authorized to ſit under the Cloath of State, on the Right hand of the Throne; and to have all the Honours and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that any Unkle of the Crown, either by Father or Mothers ſide, ever had. <hi>Rich</hi> was made Lord Chancellour. The firſt Act that paſt, five Biſhops only diſſenting,
<note place="margin">An Act of Repeal.</note> was, <q rend="inline">A Repeal of all Statutes that had made any thing Treaſon or Felony in the late Reign, which was not ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and of the ſix Articles, and the authority given to the Kings Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, as alſo of the Acts againſt <hi>Lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards.</hi> All who deni'd the Kings Supremacy, or aſſerted the Popes, for the firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence were to forfeit their goods, for the ſecond were to be in a <hi>Pramunire,</hi> and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170737:195"/>were to be attainted of Treaſon for the third. But if any intended to deprive the King of his Eſtate or Title, that was made Treaſon: none were to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of Words but within a month after they were ſpoken; they alſo repealed the power that the King had of annulling all Laws made, till he was twenty four years of age, and reſtrained it only to an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling them for the time to come, but that it ſhould not be of force for the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them null from the beginning.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another Act paſt with the ſame diſſent,
<note place="margin">An Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> for the Communion in both kinds, and that the people ſhould always communicate with the Prieſt, and by it irreverence to the Sacrament was condemned under ſevere pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties. Chriſt had inſtituted the Sacrament in both kinds, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions both. In the Primitive Church that cuſtome was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally obſerved, but upon the belief of Tranſubſtantiation, the reſerving and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying about the Sacrament were brought in; this made them firſt endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the World that the Cup was not neceſſary, for Wine could neither keep, nor be carried about conveniently; but it was done by degrees, the Bread was for ſome time given dipt, as it is yet in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church: but it being believed that Chriſt was entirely under either kind, and in every crumb, the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> took the Cup from the Laity; yet the <hi>Bohemians</hi> could not be brought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, ſo every where the uſe of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170737:195"/>Cup was one of the firſt things that was inſiſted on by thoſe who demanded a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. At firſt all that were preſent did communicate; and cenſures paſt on ſuch as did it not: And none were denied the Sacrament but Penitents, who were made to withdraw during the Action. But as the devotion of the World ſlackned, the people were ſtill exhorted to continue their Oblations, and come to the Sacrament, though they did not receive it; and were made believe, that the Prieſt received it in their ſtead: The name <hi>Sacrifice</hi> given to it, as being a holy Oblation, was ſo far improved, that the World came to look on the Prieſts officiating, as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the dead and living: From hence followed an infinite variety of Maſſes for all the accidents of humane life; and that was the chief part of the Prieſts trade, but it occaſioned many unſeemly jeſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, which were reſtrained by the ſame Act that put theſe down.</p>
               <p>Another Act paſt without any diſſent,
<note place="margin">An Act concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Biſhops.</note> 
                  <q rend="inline">That the <hi>Conge d'elire,</hi> and the Election purſuant to it, being but a ſhadow, ſince the perſon was named by the King, ſhould ceaſe for the future, and that Biſhops ſhould be named by the Kings Letters Patents, and thereupon be conſecrated; and ſhould hold their Courts in the Kings name, and not in their own, excepting only the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Court: And they were to uſe the Kings Seal in all their Writings, except in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170737:196"/>Collations, and Letters of Orders, in which they might uſe their own Seals.</q> The Apoſtles choſe Biſhops and Paſtors by an extraordinary gift of diſcerning Spirits, and propoſed them to the approbation of the people; yet they left no rules to make that neceſſary: In the times of Perſecution, the Clergy being maintained by the Oblations of the people, they were choſen by them. But when the Emperours became Chriſtians, the Town Councils and eminent men took the Elections out of the hands of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And the Tumults in popular Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſuch, that it was neceſſary to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them. In ſome places the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and in others the Biſhops of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince made the choice. The Emperours reſerved the Confirmation of the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the great Sees to themſelves. But when <hi>Charles</hi> the Great annexed great Territories and Regalities to Biſhopricks, a great change followed thereupon: Church-men were corrupted by this undue greatneſs, and came to depend on the humours of thoſe Princes to whom they owed this great encreaſe of their wealth. Princes named them, and inveſted them in their Sees: But the Popes intended to ſeparate the Eccleſiaſtical State from all ſubjection to Secular Princes, and to make themſelves the heads of that State, at firſt they pretended to reſtore the freedom of Elections; but theſe were now ingroſſed in a few hands, for only the Chapters choſe;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170737:196"/>The Popes had granted thirty years before this to the King of <hi>France,</hi> the nomination to all the Biſhopricks in that Kingdome; ſo the King of <hi>Englands</hi> aſſuming it was no new thing, and the way of Elections, as King <hi>Henry</hi> had ſetled it, ſeemed to be but a Mockery: ſo this change was not much condemned. The Eccleſiaſtical Courts were the Conceſſions of Princes, in which, Trials concerning Marriages, Wills and Tithes, depended, ſo the holding thoſe Courts in the Kings name, was no Invaſion on the Spiritual Function; ſince all that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Orders, was to be done ſtill in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops name, only Excommunication was ſtill left as the Cenſure of thoſe Courts, which being a Spiritual Cenſure, ought to have been reſerved to the Biſhop, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in by him only with the aſſiſtance of his Clergy: and this fatal errour then committed, has not yet met with an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual regulation.</p>
               <p>Another Act was made againſt idle Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds,
<note place="margin">An Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds.</note> that they ſhould be made ſlaves for two years, by any that ſhould ſeize on them: This was chiefly deſigned againſt ſome Vagrant Monks, as appears by the Proviſo's in the Act, for they went about the Countrey, infuſing in the People a diſlike of the Government. The ſeverity of this Act made that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation which naturally abhors ſlavery, did not care to execute it: and this made that the other Proviſo's, for ſupplying thoſe that were truly indigent, and were willing to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170737:197"/>had no effect. But as no Nation has better, and more merciful Laws, for the ſupply of the Poor, ſo the fond pity that many ſhew to the common Beggars, which no Laws have been able to reſtrain, makes that a ſort of diſſolute and idle Beggars intercept much of that Charity, which ſhould go to the relief of thoſe, that are indeed the only proper objects of it.
<note place="margin">An Act for diſſolving the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gries.</note> After this came the Act for giving the King all thoſe Chantries, which the late King had not ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on by Vertue of the Grant made to him of them. <hi>Cranmer</hi> oppoſed this much: for the poverty of the Clergy was ſuch that the State of Learning and Religion was like to ſuffer much, if it ſhould not be relieved: and yet he ſaw no probable Fond for that, but the preſerving theſe, till the King ſhould come to be at Age; and allow the ſelling them, for buying in, of at leaſt ſuch a ſhare of the Impropriations, as might afford ſome more comfortable ſubſiſtence to the Clergy: yet though he, and ſeven other Biſhops diſſented, it was paſt: After all other Acts, a General Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but clogged with ſome Exceptions, came laſt: ſome Acts were propoſed, but not paſt; one was for the free uſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, others were for a Court of Chancery in Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes, for Reſidence, and for a Reformation of the Courts of Common Law.
<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation fits.</note> The Convocation ſat at the ſame time; and moved that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion begun in the late Reign of thirty two Perſons for reforming the Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170737:197"/>Laws might be revived, and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Clergy might be admitted to ſit in the Houſe of Commons, for which they alledged a Clauſe in the Biſhops Writ and Ancient Cuſtome; and ſince ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates had under the former Reign begun to alter the form of the Service of the Church, they deſired it might be brought to perfection: and that ſome care might be had of ſupplying the poor Clergy, and relieving them from the Taxes that lay on them. This concerning the inferiour Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy's ſitting in the Houſe of Commons, was the ſubject of ſome debate, and was again ſet on foot both under Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> but to no effect. Some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that they always ſat in the Houſe of Commons, till the ſubmiſſion made in the former Reign, upon the ſuit of the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire:</hi> but that cannot be true, ſince in this Convocation, 17. years after that, in which many that had been in the former were preſent, no ſuch thing was alledged. It is not clear who thoſe Proctors of the Clergy that ſat in Parliament, were: if they were the Biſhops aſſiſtants, it is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to think they ſat in the Houſe of Lords. No mention is made of them, as having a ſhare in the Legiſlative Authority, in our Records, except in the 21. of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d. In which, mention is made, both of the Commons, the Lords Spiritual, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and the Proctors of the Clergy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to the Acts then made: which makes it ſeem moſt probable that they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170737:198"/>were the Clerks of the lower Houſe of Convocation. When the Parliament met antiently all in one Body, the inferiour Clergy had their Writs, and came to it with the other Freeholders, but when the two Houſes were ſeparated, the Clergy became alſo a diſtinct body, and gave their own Subſidies, and medled in all the concerns, and repreſented all the grievances of the Church. But now by the Act made upon the ſubmiſſion of the Clergy in the laſt Reign, their power was reduced almoſt to nothing: ſo they thought it reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to deſire, that either they might have their Repreſentatives in the Houſe of Commons, or at leaſt, that matters of Religion ſhould not paſs without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Clergy. But the raiſing the Eccleſiaſtical authority too high in former times, made this turn, that it was now depreſſed as much below its juſt limits, as it was before exalted above them: as commonly one extreme produces ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>It was reſolved that ſome Biſhops and Divines ſhould be ſent to <hi>Windſor,</hi> to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſome Reformations in the publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; for the whole lower Houſe of Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, without a contradictory Vote, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to the Bill about the Sacrament. But it is not known what oppoſition it met with in the Upper Houſe. A Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition being alſo ſet on foot concerning the lawfulneſs of the Marriage of the Clergy, thirty five ſubſcribed to the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170737:198"/>and only fourteen held the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>And thus ended this Seſſion, both of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Convocation. And the Protector being now eſtabliſhed in his power, and received by a Parliament, without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, took out a new Commiſſion, in which, beſides his former authority, he was impowered to ſubſtitute one in his room, during his abſence.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Germany</hi> the Princes of the Smalcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dick League were quite ruined;
<note place="margin">The affairs of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </note> the Duke of <hi>Saxe</hi> was defeated, and taken Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and uſed with great ſeverity and ſcorn, which he bare with an invincible great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind. The Landgrave was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to ſubmit, and had aſſurances of liberty given him; but by a trick unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the greatneſs of the Emperour, he was ſeized on and kept Priſoner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to faith given: upon this all the Princes and Towns, except <hi>Magdeburg</hi> and <hi>Brome,</hi> ſubmitted and purchaſed their pardon, at what terms the Conquerour was pleaſed to impoſe. The Biſhop and Elector of <hi>Colen,</hi> withdrew peaceably to a retirement, in which, after four years, he died: and now all <hi>Germany</hi> was at the Emperours mercy. Some Cathedrals, as that at <hi>Ausburg,</hi> were again reſtored to the Biſhops, and Maſs was ſaid in them. A Diet was alſo held, in which the Emperor obtain'd a Decree to paſs, by which <hi>matters</hi> of Religion were referred wholly to his care. The Pope, inſtead of rejoycing at this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170737:199"/>blow given the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it: for the Emperour had now in one Year made an end of a War, which he hoped would have Imbroiled him his whole life; ſo that <hi>Italy</hi> was now more at his mercy than ever: and it ſeemed the Emperour intended to inlarge his Conqueſts there, for the Pope's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Son being killed by a Conſpiracy, the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> ſeized on <hi>Placentia,</hi> which gave the Pope ſome jealouſie, as if the Emperour had been privy to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt his Son. The Emperour's Ambaſſadors were alſo very uneaſie to the Legates at <hi>Trent,</hi> and preſt a Reformation of abuſes, and endeavoured to reſtrain them from proceeding in points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: ſo they took hold of the firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence they had by the death of one that ſeemed to have ſome ſymptomes of the Plague, and removed it to <hi>Bologna.</hi> By this all the advantages the Emperour had from the Promiſes which the Proteſtants made, to ſubmit to a free General Council aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in <hi>Germany,</hi> were defeated: and it was thought a ſtrange turn of Divine Providence, that when the extirpation of <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> was ſo near being effected, a ſtop was put to it by that which of all things was leaſt to be apprehended: ſince it might have been expected that the perfecting ſuch a deſign would have made the Pope and the Emperor friends, though there had been ever ſo many other grounds of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between them. So unuſual a thing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170737:199"/>made the favourers of the Reformation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it to the immediate care that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had of that work, now when all the humane ſupports of it were gone. Upon this fatal revolution of affairs there, many <hi>Germans,</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> that had retired to <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> came over to <hi>England: Peter Martyr</hi> and <hi>Bernardinus Ochinus</hi> came over firſt, <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Fagius</hi> followed. They were invited over by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> till they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. <hi>Martyr</hi> was ſent to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Fagius</hi> to <hi>Cambridge;</hi> but the latter dyed ſoon after. There were ſome differences between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> concerning ſome new Forts, which were made about <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> on both ſides, yet a Truce was agreed on, for the Protector had no mind to engage in a War with <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had a new trouble raiſed up in his own Family,
<note place="margin">Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Protector and the Admiral.</note> by the Ambition of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who thought that being the Kings Uncle, as well as his Brother was, he ought to have a larger ſhare of the Government. He had made addreſſes to Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Kings ſiſter, but finding no hopes of ſucceſs, he made applications to the Queen Dowager, who married him a little unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, for it was afterwards objected to him, that he married her ſo ſoon after the Kings death, that if ſhe had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Child immediately after the marriage, it might have been doubtful whether it was by the late King, or not:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170737:200"/>yet the marriage was for ſome time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and the Admiral moved the King and his Siſters, to write to the Queen, to accept him for her Husband: The Kings Siſters excuſed themſelves, that it was not decent for them to interpoſe in ſuch a matter, but the young King was more eaſie: ſo upon his Letter, the Queen publiſhed her marriage. The Admiral being now poſſeſſed of much Wealth, and the King coming often to the Queens Lodgings, he endeavoured to gain him, and all that were about him, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the King often with Money. His deſign was, that whereas in former times, when Infant-Kings had two Uncles, one was Governour of his Perſon, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was Protector of the Realm; ſo now theſe two Truſts might be divided, and that he might be made Governour of the Kings Perſon. This is the true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the breach between thoſe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for the ſtory of the quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Wives about precedence, ſeems to be an ill-grounded fiction: for there was no pretence of a competition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Queen Dowager and the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of <hi>Somerſet;</hi> but the latter being a high Woman, might have perhaps infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her Husbands reſentments, over whom ſhe had an abſolute power, which gave the riſe to that ſtory. The Protector was at firſt very eaſie to be reconciled to his Brother, but after the many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations he received from him, he threw
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170737:200"/>off nature too much. When he was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Admiral began to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage upon that to make a party: And the good advices that were given him by <hi>Paget,</hi> to look on thoſe as the common Enemies of their Family, who were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this breach between them, had no effect to cure a mind hurried on by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. It was the advertiſement that was ſent him of this, that made the Protector leave <hi>Scotland</hi> before he had finiſhed his buſineſs there. During the Seſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the Admiral prevailed with the King to write with his own hand a Meſſage to the Houſe of Commons, to make him the Governour of his perſon. When the Admiral was making Friends in order to this, it came to his Brothers ears, before he had made any publick uſe of it: So he employed ſome to divert him from it, but with no ſucceſs. Upon that, he was ſent for to appear before the Council, but he refuſed to come; yet they having threatned to turn him out of all his places, and to ſend him to the <hi>Tower,</hi> he ſubmitted, and the Brothers were reconciled: But the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral continued his ſecret practices ſtill with thoſe about the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gardiner</hi> being included in the Act of Pardon, was ſet at liberty:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1548"/> He promiſed to receive and obey the Injunctions, only he excepted to the Homily of Juſtification; yet he complied in that likewiſe: but it was viſible that in his heart he abhorred all their proceedings, though he outwardly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170737:201"/>conformed. The Second Marriage of the M. of <hi>Northampton</hi> was tried at this time, for his firſt Wife being convict of Adultery, he and ſhe were ſeparated.
<note place="margin">The M. of <hi>Northam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptons</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.</note> And he moved in the end of the former Reign, that he might be ſuffered to marry again; ſo a Commiſſion was then granted, and was renewed in this Reign to ſome Delegates to examine what relief might be given to the innocent perſon in ſuch a caſe. But this being new, and <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> proceeding in it with his uſual exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is often accompanied with ſlowneſs, the Marqueſs became impatient, and married a ſecond Wife: Upon this, the Council ordered them to be parted till the Delegates ſhould give ſentence. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for the ſecond Marriage were theſe, Chriſt had condemned Divorces for other caſes, but excepted that of Adultery. A Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from Bed and Board, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bond ſtanding, was contrary to many places of Scripture, that mention the end of Marriage. S. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcharges the married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if the other wilfully deſerted him, much more will it follow in the caſe of Adultery. And though St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays the Wife is tyed to her Husband as long as he liveth, that is only to be underſtood of a Husband that continued to be one; but that relation ceaſed by Adultery. The Fathers differed in their opinions in this matter, ſome allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Marriage upon Divorce to the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but denied it to the Wife; others allowed it to both. So <hi>Tertullian, Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Baſil; Jerome</hi> alſo juſtified <hi>Fabiolae</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:170737:201"/>that had done it. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Chroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> allowed a ſecond Marriage. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was doubtful about it. The <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours allowed by their Laws, even after they became Chriſtians, Divorce, and a ſecond Marriage, both to Husbands and Wives, upon many other Reaſons beſides Adultery; as for procuring Abortions, treating for another Marriage, being guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or a Wifes going to Plays without her Husbands leave. Nor did the Fathers in thoſe times complain of thoſe Laws: This was alſo allowed by the Canons upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occaſions; but after the State of Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libate came to be magnified out of meaſure, ſecond Marriages were more generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: And this was heightned when Marriage was lookt on as a Sacrament. Yet though no Divorces were allowed in the Church, the Canoniſts found out many ſhifts for annulling Marriages from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to thoſe that could pay well for them. All theſe things being conſidered, the Delegates gave ſentence, confirming the ſecond Marriage, and diſſolving the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Candlemaſs</hi> and <hi>Lent</hi> were now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<note place="margin">Some Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies abrogated</note> ſo the Clergy and People were much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with relation to the Ceremonies uſual at thoſe times. By ſome Injunctions in K. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Reign it had been declared, that Faſting in <hi>Lent</hi> was only binding by a poſitive Law. Wakes and Plough Moondays were alſo ſuppreſſed, and hints were given that other cuſtomes which were much abuſed, ſhould
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170737:202"/>be ſhortly put down. The groſs Rabble loved theſe things, as matters of diverſion, and thought Divine Worſhip without them would be but a dull buſineſs. But others lookt on theſe as Relicts of Heatheniſm, ſince the <hi>Gentiles</hi> worſhipped their Gods with ſuch Feſtivities, and thought they did not become the gravity and ſimplicity of the Chriſtian Religion. <hi>Cranmer</hi> upon this procured an Order of Council againſt the carrying of Candles on <hi>Candlemaſs</hi> day, of Aſhes on <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday,</hi> and Palms on <hi>Palm-Sunday;</hi> which was directed to <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> to be intimated to the Biſhops of the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and was executed by him. But a Proclamation followed againſt all that ſhould make changes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Authority: The creeping to the Croſs and taking Holy Bread and Water, were by it put down, and power was given to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to certifie, in the Kings name, what Ceremonies ſhould be afterwards laid aſide; and none were to preach out of their own Pariſhes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out licence from the King or the Viſitors, the Arch-biſhop or the Biſhop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Some queſtioned the Councils power to make ſuch Orders, the Act that gave authority to their Proclamations being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed; but it was ſaid the Kings Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in Eccleſiaſtical matters might well juſtifie their making ſuch 'Rules.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Febr.</hi> 8.</note> Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, a General Order followed for a removal of all Images out of Churches: There were every where great conteſts
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170737:202"/>whether the Images had been abuſed to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition or not. Some thought the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of them was an abuſe common to them all. Thoſe alſo that repreſented the Trinity, as a man with three faces in one head, or as an old man with a young man before him, and a Dove over his head; and ſome where the Bleſſed Virgin was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as aſſumed into it, gave ſo great ſcandal, that it was no wonder, if men, as they grew to be better enlightned, could no longer endure them. The only occaſion given to cenſure in this order, was, that all Shrines, and the Plate belonging to them, were appointed to be brought in to the Kings uſe. A Letter was at that time writ to all Preachers, requiring them to exhort the people to amend their lives, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Superſtition; but for things not yet changed, to bear with them, and not to run before thoſe whom they ſhould obey. Some hot men condemned this temper, as ſavouring too much of carnal Policy; but it was ſaid, that though the Apoſtles by the gift of Miracles, had ſufficient means to convince the World of their authority; Yet they did not all at once change the cuſtomes of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by degrees; and Chriſt forbid the pulling up the Tares, leſt good Wheat ſhould be pulled up with them; ſo it was fit to wean people by degrees from their former ſuperſtition, and not to run too faſt.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:170737:203"/>
               <p>Eighteen Biſhops, and ſome Divines, were now imployed to examine the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Church, to ſee which of them needed amendment.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> new Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> They began with the Euchariſt: They proceeded in the ſame manner that was uſed in the former Reign. For every one gave in his opinion in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in anſwer to the queſtions that were put to them. Some of theſe are ſtill preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which were concerning the Prieſts ſole communicating, and Maſſes ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the dead, the Maſs in an unknown tongue, the hanging it up and expoſing it and the Sacrifice that was made in it. In moſt of thoſe Papers it appears that the greateſt part of the Biſhops were ſtill lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened with the old ſuperſtition, at leaſt to ſome degree. It was clearly found that the plain Inſtitution of the Sacrament was was much vitiated, with a mixture of many Heatheniſh Rites and Pomps, on deſign to raiſe the credit of the Prieſts, in whoſe hands that great performance was lodged. This was at firſt done to draw over the Heathens by thoſe ſplendid Rites to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; but Superſtition once begun, has no bounds nor meaſures; and ignorance and barbarity encreaſing in the darker ages, there was no regard had to any thing in Religion, but as it was ſet off with much Pageantry: And the belief of the Corporal preſence raiſed this to a great height. The Office was in an unknown tongue, all the Veſſels and Garments belonging to it, were conſecrated with much devotion,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170737:203"/>a great part of the Service was ſecret, to make it look like a wonderful charm; the Conſecration it ſelf was to be ſaid very ſoftly, for words that were not to be heard, agreed beſt with a change that was not to be ſeen: The many Geſticulations and the magnificent Proceſſions all tended to raiſe this Pageantry higher. Maſſes were alſo ſaid for all the turns and affairs of humane life. Trentals, a cuſtome of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thirty Maſſes a year on the chief Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities for redeeming Souls out of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was that which brought the Prieſts moſt Money, for theſe were thought Gods beſt days, in which aeceſs was eaſier to him. On Saints days, in the Maſs it was prayed, that by the Saints Interceſſion, the Sacrifice might become the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and procure a larger Indulgence, which could not be eaſily explained, if the Sacrifice was the death of Chriſt; beſides a numberleſs variety of other Rites, ſo many of the Relicts of Heatheniſm were made uſe of for the corrupting of the holieſt inſtitution of the Chriſtian Religion. The firſt ſtep that was now made, was a new Office for the Communion, that is, the diſtribution of the Sacrament, for the Office of Conſecration was not at this time touched. It differs very little from what is ſtill uſed. In the Exhortation, Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Confeſſion to a Prieſt is left free to be done or omitted, and all were required not to judge one another in that matter. There was alſo a denunciation made requiring
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170737:204"/>impenitent ſinners to withdraw. The Bread was to be ſtill of the ſame form that had been formerly uſed. In the diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was ſaid, <hi>The Body of our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>preſerve thy Body,</hi> and <hi>The Blood of our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>preſerve thy Soul.</hi> This was Printed with a Proclamation, requiring all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it with ſuch Reverence and Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as might encourage the King to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further, and not to run to other things before the King gave direction, aſſuring the people of his earneſt zeal to ſet forth Godly Orders; and therefore it was hoped they would tarry for it: The Books were ſent over <hi>England,</hi> and the Clergy were appointed to give the Communion next <hi>Eaſter</hi> according to them.</p>
               <p>Many were much offended to find Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion left indifferent,
<note place="margin">Auricular Confeſſion examined.</note> ſo this matter was examined. Chriſt gave his Apoſtles a power of binding and looſing, and S. <hi>James</hi> commanded all to confeſs their faults to one another. In the Primitive Church all that denied the Faith, or otherwiſe gave ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, were ſeparated from the Communion, and not admitted to it till they made publick Confeſſion: And according to the degrees of their ſins, the time and degrees of publick Penitence, and their Separation were proportioned: Which was the chief ſubject of the Conſultations of the Councils in the fourth and fifth Centuries. For ſecret ſins the people lay under no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to confeſs, but they went often to their Prieſts for direction, even for theſe.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170737:204"/>Near the end of the fifth Century they began to have ſecret Penances and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions as well as publick: But in the ſeventh Century this became the general practice. In the eighth Century the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of Penance for Money, or other Services done the Church, was brought in. Then the Holy Wars and Pilgrimages came to be magnified: Croiſadoes againſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, or Princes depoſed by the Pope, were ſet up inſtead of all other Penances: Prieſts alſo managed Confeſſion and Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, ſo as to enter into all mens ſecrets, and to govern their Conſciences by them; but they becoming very ignorant, and not ſo aſſociated as to be governed by Orders that might be ſent them from <hi>Rome,</hi> the Friers were every where imployed to hear Confeſſions, and many reſerved Caſes were made, in which the Pope only gave Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; theſe were truſted to them, and they had the Trade of Indulgences put in their hands, which they managed with as much conſidence as Mountebanks uſed in ſelling their Medicines, with this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that the ineffectualneſs of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices was not ſo eaſily diſcovered, for the people believed all that the Prieſts told them. In this they grew to ſuch a pitch of confidence, that for ſaying ſome Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, Indulgences for years, and for Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, Thouſands, yea, a Million of years; were granted; ſo cheap a thing was Heaven made. This trade was now thrown out of the Church, and private
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170737:205"/>Confeſſion was declared indifferent: But it was much cenſured that no Rules for Publick Penance were ſet up at this time, but what were corrupted by the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts. The people did not think a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative Abſolution ſufficient, and thought it ſurer work when a Prieſt ſaid, <hi>I Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve thee,</hi> though that was but a late In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Others cenſured the words of diſtribution, by which the Bread was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Body, and the Cup to the Soul: And this was ſoon after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, only ſome words relating to it are ſtill in the Collect, <hi>We do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The affairs of State took up the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gardiner</hi> is impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> as much as the matters of Religion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the Biſhops, the War with <hi>Scotland</hi> grew chargeable, and was ſupported from <hi>France,</hi> but the ſale of the Chantry Lands brought the Council in ſome Money. <hi>Gardiner</hi> was brought into new trouble, many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were made of him, that he diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Preachers ſent with the Kings li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence into his Dioceſs, and that he ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed all Reformation. So being brought before the Council, he denied moſt of the things objected to him, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to explain himſelf openly in a Sermon before the King. The Protector preſt him not to meddle in matters, not yet determined, particularly the preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, and to aſſert the Kings power, though he was under age, and the Authority of the Council: for the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170737:205"/>Clergy began generally to ſay, that though they acknowledged the Kings Supremacy; yet they would not yield it to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and ſeemed to place it in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary grace conferred on the King by the Anointing in the Coronation. So the Protector deſired <hi>Gardiner</hi> to declare himſelf in thoſe points; but when he came to preach on St. <hi>Peters</hi> day, he inveighed againſt the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy, and aſſerted the Kings, but ſaid nothing of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, nor the Kings power under Age: he alſo juſtified the ſuppreſſion of Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Chantries, and the putting down Maſſes ſatisfactory, as alſo the removing of Images, the Sacrament in both kinds, and the new Order for the Communion; but did largely aſſert the Corporal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the Sacrament: Upon which there was a noiſe raiſed by hot Men of both ſides, during the Sermon, and this was ſaid to be a ſtirring of ſedition, and upon that he was ſent to the <hi>Tower.</hi> This way of proceeding was thought contrary both to Law and Juſtice, and as all violent courſes do, this rather weakned than ſtrengthned thoſe that were moſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. <hi>Cranmer</hi> did at this time ſet out a large Catechiſm, which he dedicated to the King. He inſiſted much on ſhewing, that Idolatry had been committed in the uſe of Images: he aſſerted the Divine Inſtitution of Biſhops and Prieſts, and their authority of Abſolving ſinners, and expreſſed great Zeal for ſetting up Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170737:206"/>Canons, and exhorted the People to diſcover the ſtate of their Souls to their Paſtors: from this it appears, that he had changed the opinions, he former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held, againſt the Divine Inſtitution of the Eccleſiaſtical Offices.</p>
               <p>But now a more general Reformation of the whole Liturgy was under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> new Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</note> that all the Nation might have an Uniformity in the Worſhip of God; and be no more cantoned to the ſeveral Uſes of <hi>Sarum, York, Lincoln, Hereford</hi> and <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor.</hi> Anciently the Liturgies were ſhort, and had few Ceremonies in them: Every Biſhop had one for his own Dioceſs: but in the <hi>African</hi> Churches, they began firſt to put them into a more Regular Form. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, labour'd much in this; yet he left <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk to his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, either to uſe the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>French</hi> forms in <hi>England,</hi> as he found they were like to tend moſt to Edification. Great Additions were made in every Age, for the private Devotions of ſome that were reputed Saints, were added to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick offices: and myſterious ſignifications were invented for every new Rite, which was the chief ſtudy of ſome Ages: and all was ſwelled up to a vaſt bulk. It was not then thought on, that praying by the ſpirit, conſiſted in the inventing new words, and uttering them with warmth; and it ſeemed too great a ſubjection of the People to their Prieſts, that they ſhould make them joyn with them in all
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170737:206"/>their heats in prayer: and would have proved as great a reſignation of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to them, as the former ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had made of their faith. It was then reſolved to have a Liturgy, and to bring the Worſhip to a fit mean, between the Pomp of Superſtition, and naked flatneſs. They reſolved to change nothing, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in oppoſition to received practices, but rather in Imitation of what Chriſt did, in the Inſtitution of the two Sacraments of the Goſpel, that did conſiſt of Rites uſed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> but bleſſed by him to higher purpoſes, to comply with what had been formerly in uſe, as much as was poſſible thereby to gain the People. All the Conſecrations of Water, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> lookt like the remainders of Heatheniſm, and were laid aſide: by theſe Devils being adjured, and a Divine vertue ſuppoſed to be in them, the People came to think, that by ſuch obſervances, they might be ſure of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The Abſolutions, by which, upon the account of the Merits of the Bleſſed Virgin, and the Saints, the ſprinklings of Water, Faſtings and Pilgrimages, with many other things, ſins were pardoned, as well as on the account of the Paſſion of Chriſt, and the Abſolution given to dead bodies, lookt like groſs Impoſtures, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make the World think, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the painful way to Heaven, in a courſe of true Holineſs, the Prieſts had ſecrets in their hands, of carrying Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170737:207"/>thither in another Method, and on eaſier terms; and this drew in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to purchaſe their favour, eſpecially when they were dying: ſo that, as their fears were then heightned, there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way left them, in the concluſion of an ill life, to dye with any good hopes, but as they bargained for them with their Prieſts; therefore all this was now caſt out. It was reſolved to have the whole wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Vulgar Tongue, upon which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> has copiouſly enlarged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: and all Nations, as they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſtianity, had their Offices in their Vulgar Tongue; but of late, it had been pretended, that it was a part of the Communion of Saints, that the worſhip ſhould be every where in the ſame Language; though the People were hardly uſed, when for the ſake of ſome Vagrant Prieſts, that might come from foreign Parts, they were kept from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was ſaid in the worſhip of God. It was pretended, that <hi>Pilate</hi> having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Inſcription on the Croſs, in <hi>Greek, Latine,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> theſe three Languages were ſanctified; but it is not eaſie to underſtand what authority he had, for conferring ſuch a priviledge on them. But the keeping all in an Unknown Tongue, preſerved in dark Ages the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of their Offices, in which there were ſuch Prayers and Hymns, and ſuch Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that if the People had underſtood them, they muſt have given great ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170737:207"/>In many Prayers the pardon of ſins, and the grace of God were asked, in ſuch a ſtile, of the Saints, as if theſe had been wholly at their diſpoſal, and as if they had been more merciful than God, or Chriſt. In former times all that did officiate, were peculiarly habited, and all their Garments were bleſſed: and theſe were conſidered, as a part of the train of the Maſs; but on the other hand, white had been the colour of the Prieſts Veſtments, under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, and was early brought into the Chriſtian Churches: it was a proper expreſſion of Innocence, and it was fit that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God ſhould be in a decent habit. So it was continued, and ſince the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices offered to Idols, were not thereby according to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> of their own nature polluted, and every Creature of God was good, it was thought, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the former abuſe, moſt reaſonable to uſe theſe Garments ſtill.</p>
               <p>The Morning and Evening Prayers were put almoſt in the ſame Method,
<note place="margin">The new Offices.</note> in which we uſe them ſtill, only there was no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion nor Abſolution. In the Office for the Communion, there was a Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thankſgiving, for the Bleſſed Virgin, and all departed Saints, and they were commended to God's mercy and peace. In the Conſecration, the uſe of croſſing the Elements was retained, but there was no Elevation, which was at firſt uſed as an hiſtorical Rite, to ſhew
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170737:208"/>Chriſt's being lifted up on the Croſs; but was afterwards done, to call on the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to adore it. No ſtamp was to be on the Bread, and it was to be thicker than ordinary. It was to be put in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples mouths by the Prieſts, though it had been anciently put in their hands. Some in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church began to take it in Spoons of Gold, others in a Linnen cloth, called their <hi>Dominical:</hi> but after the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral preſence was received, the People were not ſuffered to touch it, and the Prieſts Thumbs and Fingers were peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly anointed, to qualifie them for that Contact. In Baptiſm, the Child's head and breaſt was croſt, and an adjuration was made of the Devil, to depart from him: Children were to be thrice dipt, or in caſe of weakneſs, water was to be ſprinkled on their faces, and then they were to be anointed. The ſick might alſo be anointed, if they deſired it. At Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, the departed Soul was recommended to God's mercy.</p>
               <p>The Sacraments were formerly believed, of ſuch vertue,
<note place="margin">Private Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> that they conferred Grace, by the very receiving them, <hi>ex opere ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato:</hi> and ſo Women baptized. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did ſend portions of the Euchariſt to the ſick, but without any Pomp: which came in, when the Corporal Preſence was believed. But inſtead of that, it was now appointed, that the Sacraments ſhould be miniſtred to the ſick, and therefore in caſe of weakneſs, Children might be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170737:208"/>in Houſes; though it was more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the deſign of Baptiſm, which was the admiſſion of a new Member to the Church, to do it before the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: But this, which was a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for weakneſs, is become ſince a mark of Vanity, and a piece of affected ſtate. It was alſo appointed, that the Sacrament ſhould be given to the ſick, and not to be ſent from the Church, but Conſecrated by their Bed-ſides: ſince Chriſt had ſaid, that where two or three were aſſembled, in his name, he would be in the midſt of them. But it is too groſs a Relique of the worſt part of Popery, if any imagine, that after an ill life, ſome ſudden ſorrow for ſin, with a haſty Abſolution, and the Sacrament will be a paſſeport to Heaven, ſince the mercies of God in Chriſt are offered in the Goſpel, only to thoſe who truly believe, ſincerely repent, and do change the courſe of their Lives.</p>
               <p>The Liturgy thus compiled, was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with a Preface, concerning Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: the ſame that is ſtill in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book, written with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary judgment and temper.</p>
               <p>When the Book came into all Mens hands, ſeveral things were cenſured:
<note place="margin">Cenſures paſt on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Book.</note> as particularly the frequent uſe of the Croſs and Anointing. The former began to be uſed, as a badge of a crucified Saviour: but the ſuperſtition of it was ſo much advanced, that <hi>Latria</hi> was given to the Croſier. The uſing it was alſo believed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170737:209"/>to have a Virtue for driving away evil ſpirits, and preſerving one from dangers: ſo that a Sacramental vertue was affixed to it, which could not be done, ſince there is no Inſtitution for it in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but the uſing it as a Ceremony, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the believing in a crucified Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, could import no ſuperſtition, ſince Ceremonies, that only expreſs our duty or profeſſion, may be uſed as well as words, theſe being ſigns, as the other are ſounds, that expreſs our thoughts. The uſe of Oyl in Confirmation, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Penitents, was early brought into the Church: but it was not applied to the ſick, till the 10th. Century; for the Ancients did not underſtand thoſe words of Saint <hi>James,</hi> to relate to it, but to the extraordinary gift of healing, then in the Church.</p>
               <p>While theſe changes were under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
<note place="margin">All Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was for ſome time reſtrained.</note> there were great heats every where, and a great contradiction among the Pulpits; ſome commending all the old cuſtomes, and others inveighing as much againſt them: ſo the power of granting Licences to preach, was taken from the Biſhops, and reſtrained only to the King and the Archbiſhops; yet even that did not prove an effectual reſtraint. So a Proclamation was ſet out, reſtraining all Preaching, till the Order, which was then in the hands of the Biſhops, ſhould be finiſhed; and inſtead of hearing Sermons, all were required to apply themſelves to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170737:209"/>Prayer, for a bleſſing on that which was then a preparing, and to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the mean while with the Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
               <p>The War of <hi>Scotland</hi> continued:
<note place="margin">Affairs in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> the <hi>Scots</hi> received a great ſupply from <hi>France</hi> of 6000. Men, under the command of <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> had fortified <hi>Hadington,</hi> which was well ſituated, and lay in a fruitful Countrey: ſo the Governour of <hi>Scotland</hi> joyning an Army of <hi>Scots</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> ſat down before it. The Protector ſaw the inconveniencies of a long War coming on him, both with <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> ſo he offered a truce for 10. years, in which time he hoped by preſents and practices, to gain, or at leaſt to divide thoſe, who were united by the War. Many of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nobility liked the Propoſition well: and indeed the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the <hi>French</hi> was ſuch, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being Auxiliaries, they conſidered them as Enemies. But the Clergy were ſo apprehenſive of a Match with <hi>England,</hi> that they never concluded themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, till it were put out of their power: and ſo did vehemently promote the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition made by the <hi>French,</hi> of ſending their Queen over to <hi>France:</hi> and this was in concluſion agreed to. So the <hi>French</hi> Ships that brought over the Auxiliaries, carried back the young Queen. The ſiege of <hi>Hadington</hi> went on: a great recruit ſent to them from <hi>Berwick</hi> was intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and cut off: but they were well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170737:210"/>with Ammunition and Proviſions. Some Caſtles that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had, were taken by ſurprize, and others by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery: a Fleet was ſent to ſpoil the Coaſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the Admirals command, but he made only two deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, in both which he had ſuch ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that he loſt near 1200. Men in them. The Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> led in a good Army to the Relief of <hi>Hadington:</hi> The Siege was opened, and the place well ſupplied. But as <hi>Deſſy</hi> marched back to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> his Souldiers committed great out rages upon the <hi>Scots,</hi> ſo that if <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> had deſigned to fight, he had great advantages, ſince the <hi>Scots</hi> were now very weary of their imperious friends, the <hi>French:</hi> but he marched back, having performed that for which he was ſent. <hi>Deſſy</hi> followed him, and made a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road into <hi>England,</hi> but would not give the <hi>Scots</hi> any ſhare of the ſpoil, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them in all things, as a conquered Province: and being in fear of them, he fortified himſelf in <hi>Leith,</hi> which before was but an inconſiderable Village. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo attacked the Fort which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had in <hi>Inchkeith,</hi> and took it. But he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called upon the Complaints that were ſent to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> againſt him. Now the People there began to feel their ſlavery, and to hate thoſe that had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the ſending their Queen to <hi>France,</hi> and particularly the Clergy, and were thereby the more diſpoſed to hearken to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170737:210"/>ſuch Preachers, as diſcovered their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and ſuperſtition. <hi>Monluc</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> a Man celebrated for wiſdom, and for ſo much moderation in matters of Religion, that it drew upon him the ſuſpicion of Hereſie, was ſent over from <hi>France</hi> to be Chancellor of <hi>Scotland.</hi> This was like to give great diſcontent to the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Nobility: ſo he returned to <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were now involved in a War, in which they could promiſe themſelves no good iſſue, unleſs they could conquer the Kingdom: for the end they had propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a Match, was now put out of the power, even of the <hi>Scots</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170737:211"/>he returned to his ſtudies, which were chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imployed in the Scriptures. The Book was propoſed to the Diet, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> without any Order, thanked the Emperour for it, in their name, and this was publiſhed, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Diet. So ſlight a thing will paſs for a conſent of the States, by a Conquerour that looks on himſelf as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Law. Both Papiſts and Proteſtants were offended at it. It was condemned at <hi>Rome,</hi> where no Hereſie was more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than that the Secular Powers ſhould meddle in points of Faith. The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants generally refuſed it: and the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd Elector could not be wrought on to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, neither by the Offers that were made him, nor the ſeverities he was put to, in all which he was always the ſame. Some conteſts aroſe between <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and the other <hi>Lutherans:</hi> for he thought the Ceremonies, being things indifferent, might be received; but the others thought theſe would make way for all the other errors of Popery. The Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was now almoſt ruined in <hi>Germany,</hi> and this made the Divines turn their eyes to <hi>England.

               <p>In the end of this Year,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> Seſſion of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note> a Seſſion of Parliament met, but no Bill was finiſhed before <hi>February;</hi> the firſt was concerning the married Clergy, which was finiſhed by the Commons in ſix days, but lay ſix Weeks before the Lords: Nine Biſhops, and four Temporal Lords proteſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. It was declared,
<note place="margin">An Act for the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Clergy.</note> that it were better for Prieſts to live unmarried, free of all worldly cares; yet ſince the Laws compelling it, had occaſioned great filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they were all repealed. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Chaſtity in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, had poſſeſſed the World with a high o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of them, and had been a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the Reformers, if the World had not clearly ſeen through it, and been made very ſenſible of the ill effects of it, by the defilement it brought into their own Beds and Families. Nor was there any point in which the Reformers had enquired more, to remove this prejudice, that lay againſt them. In the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all the Prieſts were not only mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but the Office deſcended by Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. In the New Teſtament, Marriage was declared <hi>Honourable in all:</hi> among the qualifications of Biſhops and Deacons, their being the <hi>Husbands of one Wife,</hi> are reckoned up. Many of the Apoſtles were married, and carried their Wives about
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170737:212"/>with them, as alſo <hi>Aquila</hi> did <hi>Priſcilla.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to marry, is reckoned a mark of the Apoſtaſie, that was to follow. Some of the firſt Hereticks inveighed againſt Marriage, but the Orthodox juſtified it, and condemned thoſe Churchmen that put away their Wives: which was confirmed by a General Council, in the fifth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury:
<note place="margin">In <hi>Trullo.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> oppoſed a motion that was made for it: <hi>Hilary</hi> of <hi>Poictiers</hi> was married, <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi>'s Fathers were Biſhops. <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> the firſt that wrote a Romance, moved that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops might live ſingly; but till then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one did in that as he pleaſed, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe who were twice married, if the firſt was before their Converſion might be Biſhops, which <hi>Jerome</hi> himſelf, though very partial to celibate, juſtifies; all the Canons made againſt the married Clergy, were only poſitive Laws, which might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed. The Prieſts in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church did ſtill live with their Wives at that time; In the Weſt, the Clergy did gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally marry; and in <hi>Edgar</hi>'s time, they were for the moſt part married in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> In the Ninth Century <hi>P. Nicolas</hi> preſt the Celibate much, but was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by many. In the Eleventh Century, <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7th. intending to ſet up a new Eccleſiaſtical Empire, found that the unmarried Clergy would be the ſureſt to him, ſince the married gave Pledges to the State, and therefore he proceeded furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in it; and called all the married
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170737:212"/>Prieſts, <hi>Nicolaitans:</hi> yet in <hi>England, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franc</hi> did only impoſe the Celibate on the Prebendaries, and the Clergy that lived in Towns: <hi>Anſelm</hi> impoſed it on all without exception; but both he, <hi>Bernard,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus Damiani,</hi> complain, that <hi>Sodomy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded much, even among the Biſhops: And not only <hi>Panormitan,</hi> but <hi>Pius</hi> the 2d. wiſhed, that the Laws for the Celibate were taken away. So it was clear, that it was not founded on the Laws of God: and it was a ſin to force Churchmen to vow that which ſometimes was not in their power: and it was found by examining the forms of Ordination, that the Prieſts in <hi>England</hi> had made no ſuch vows; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the vow in the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontifical to live chaſtly, did not import a tie not to marry, ſince a Man might live Chaſt in a married ſtate. Many lewd ſtories were publiſhed of the Clergy, but none ſeemed more remarkable, than that of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Legate, in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond's time, who the very ſame Night after he had put all the married Clergy from their Benefices, was found a-bed with a Whore. It was alſo obſerved that the unmarried Biſhops, if they had not Baſtards to raiſe, were as much ſet on advancing their Nephews and Kindred, as thoſe that were married could be: Nor did any Perſons meddle more in ſecular affairs, than the unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Clergy: and it might be reaſonable to reſtrain the Clergy, as was done in the Primitive Church, from converting the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170737:213"/>Goods of the Church, which were entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to their care, to the enriching of their Families. None appeared more zealous for procuring this liberty, than ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Clergy men that never made uſe of it, in particular <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Redmayn.</hi>

<note place="margin">An Act confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy.</note> confirming the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, which was now finiſhed, Eight Biſhops, and three Temporal Lords only proteſting againſt it. There was a long preamble, ſetting forth the inconvenience of the former Offices, and the pains that had been taken to reform them; and that diverſe Biſhops and Divines had, by the aid of the Holy Ghoſt, with an uniform agreement concluded on the new Book: therefore they Enacted, That by <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunday</hi> next, all Divine Offices ſhould be performed according to it, and if any uſed other Offices, for the firſt offence they ſhould be impriſoned ſix months, loſe their Benefices for a ſecond, and be impriſoned during life for the third offence. Some cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured thoſe words, that the Book was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the <hi>Aid of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> but this did not import an <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> but a <hi>Divine aſſiſtance.</hi> Many wondred to ſee the Biſhops of <hi>Norwich, Hereford, Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> proteſt againſt the Act, ſince they had concurred in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Book. It does not appear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were diſſatisfied at any thing in it, or whether they oppoſed the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it on ſuch ſevere penalties; or if they were diſpleaſed at a Proviſo that was
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170737:213"/>added for the uſing of Pſalms taken out of the Bible, which was intended for the ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pſalms then put in Verſe, and much uſed both in Churches and Houſes, by all that loved the Reformation. In the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times the Chriſtians uſed the Pſalter much, and the chief devotion of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick Orders conſiſted in repeating it often. <hi>Apollinarius</hi> put it in Verſe, and both <hi>Nazianzen</hi> and <hi>Prudentius</hi> wrote ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny devout Hymns in Verſe: Others, though in Proſe, were much uſed, as the <hi>Gloria in Excelſis,</hi> and the <hi>Te Deum:</hi> afterwards the greateſt part of the Offices was put in <hi>Latin</hi> Rhimes, and ſo now ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets turned the Pſalter into Verſe, which was then much eſteemed; but both our Language and Poetry, being ſince that time much improved, this work has now loſt its beauty ſo much, that there is great need of a new Verſion.</p>
               <p>Another Act paſt about Faſting,
<note place="margin">An Act for Faſting.</note> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <q rend="inline">That though all days and meats were in themſelves alike, yet faſting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great help to vertue, and to the ſubduing the Body to the mind, and a diſtinction of meats conducing to the advancement of the Fiſhing trade, it was Enacted, That <hi>Lent,</hi> and all <hi>Fridays</hi> and <hi>Saturdays,</hi> and <hi>Ember</hi> days ſhould be Fiſh days, under ſeveral penalties, exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting the weak, or thoſe that had the Kings Licence.</q> Chriſt had told his Diſciples, that when he was taken from them, they ſhould <hi>faſt:</hi> So in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170737:214"/>Church they faſted before <hi>Eaſter;</hi> but the ſame number of days was not obſerved in all places; afterwards other rules and days were ſet up: but S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> complained, that many in his time placed all their Religion in obſerving them. Faſt-days were turned to a mockery in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which they both dined, and did eat Fiſh dreſt exquiſitely, and drank Wine. This made many run to another extream againſt all Faſts, or diſtinction of days, which certainly, if rightly managed, and without ſuperſtition, is a great means for keeping up a ſeriouſneſs of mind, which is neceſſary for maintaining the power of Religion. Other Bills were propoſed, but not paſt, one for making it Treaſon to marry the Kings Siſters, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the King and Council: But the forfeiture of Succeſſion in that caſe was thought ſufficient. The Biſhops did alſo complain of their want of power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs vice, which ſo much abounded: But the Laity were ſo apprehenſive of coming again under an Eccleſiaſtical Tyranny, that they would not conſent to it. A Propoſition was alſo made for bringing the Common Law into a body, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Digeſts: But it fell, being too great a deſign to be finiſhed under an Infant King.</p>
               <p>In this Parliament the Admiral was At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted.
<note place="margin">The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder.</note> The Queen Dowager died in <hi>September</hi> laſt, not without ſuſpicion of Poiſon; upon that he renewed his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170737:214"/>to Lady <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but finding it in vain to expect that his Brother and the Council would conſent to it, and that her right to the Succeſſion would be cut off if he married her without their conſent, he reſolved to make ſure of the Kings Perſon, till he made a change in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: He fortified his Houſe, he laid up a Magazine, and made a party among the Nobility. The Protector imployed many to divert him from thoſe deſperate deſigns, but his Ambition being incurable, he was forced to proceed to extremities againſt him. He ſent him Priſoner to the <hi>Tower</hi> in <hi>January,</hi> with his Confederate <hi>Sharington,</hi> who being Vice-Treaſurer of the Mint at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> had ſupplied him with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and had coined much baſe Money for his uſe. Many were ſent to perſwade him to a better mind, and his Brother was willing to be again reconciled to him, if he would retire from the Court and buſineſs; but he was intractable. So, many Articles were objected to him, both of his deſigns againſt the State, and of his Malverſation in his Office, ſeveral Pyrates having been entertained by him. Many Witneſſes and Letters under his own hand, were brought againſt him. Almoſt the whole Council went to the <hi>Tower</hi> and examined him; but he refuſed to make any Anſwers, and ſaid he expected an open Tryal. The whole Council upon this, acquainted the King with it, and deſired him to refer the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Parliament, which he granted.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170737:215"/>Upon that, ſome Counſellors were again ſent to ſee what they could draw from him, but he was ſullen, and after he had anſwered to three of the Articles, denying ſome particulars, and excuſing others, he refuſed to go any further. The buſineſs was next brought into the Houſe of Lords: The Judges and the Kings Council deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their opinions, That the Articles objected to him were Treaſon. Then the Evidence was given, upon which the whole Houſe paſt the Bill, the Protector only withdrawing: They diſpatched it in two days. In the Houſe of Commons many argued againſt Attainders without a Trial, or bringing the party to make his Anſwers. But a Meſſage was ſent from the King, deſiring them to proceed as the Lords had begun. So the Lords that had given Evidence againſt him in their own Houſe, were ſent down to the Commons: Upon which they paſt the Bill; and the Royal Aſſent was given the fifth of <hi>March:</hi> And afterwards, the King being preſt to it by the Council, gave order for the Execution, which was done the twentieth of <hi>March.</hi> This was the only cure that his Ambition ſeemed capable of: Yet it was thought againſt nature, that one Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould fall by the hand of another: And the Attainting a man without hearing him, was condemned, as contrary to Natural Juſtice; ſo that the Protector ſuffered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as much by his death as he could have done by his life.</p>

               <p>The Laity and Clergy both gave the King Subſidies, and ſo the Parliament was Prorogued. The firſt thing taken into care was the receiving the Act of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:
<note place="margin">A new Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation.</note> Some Complaints were made of the Prieſts way of officiating, that they did it with ſuch a tone of voice, that the people did not underſtand what was ſaid, no more than when the Prayers were ſaid in <hi>Latine;</hi> ſo this Temper was found: Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were ordered to be ſaid in Pariſh Churches in a plain voice, but in Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals the old way was ſtill kept up, as agreeing better with the Muſick uſed in them: Though this ſeemed not very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in the Confeſſion of ſins, nor in the <hi>Litany,</hi> where a ſimple voice, gravely ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, agreed better with thoſe devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than thoſe Cadences and unmuſical notes do. Others continued to uſe all the Geſticulations, Croſſings and Kneelings, that they had formerly been accuſtomed to: The people did alſo continue the uſe of their Beads, which were brought in by <hi>Peter Hermit,</hi> in the eleventh Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, by which the repeating the Angels Salutation to the Virgin, was made a great part of their devotion, and was ten times ſaid for one <hi>Pater Noſter.</hi> Inſtructions were given to the Viſitors to put all theſe down in a new Viſitation, and to enquire if any Prieſts continued to drive a trade by Trentals or Maſſes for departed Souls. Order was alſo given, that there ſhould be no Private Maſſes at Altars in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170737:216"/>of Churches, and that there ſhould be but one Communion in a day, unleſs it were in great Churches, and at high Feſtivals, in which they were allowed to have one Communion in the morning, and another at noon. The Viſitors made their Report, That they found the Book of Common Prayer received univerſally over all the Kingdom, only Lady <hi>Mary</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to have Maſs ſaid according to the abrogated forms: Upon this, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil wrote to her to conform to the Laws; for the nearer ſhe was to the King in blood, ſhe was ſo much the more obliged to give a good Example to the reſt of the Subjects. She refuſed to comply with their deſires, and ſent one to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for his Protection; upon which the Emperour preſſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſadours, and they promiſed that for ſome time ſhe ſhould be diſpenſed with. The Emperour pretended afterwards that they made him an abſolute Promiſe that ſhe ſhould never be more troubled about it, but they ſaid it was only a Temporary Promiſe. A Match was alſo propoſed for her with the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Brother, but it was let fall ſoon after. She refuſed to acknowledge the Laws made when the King was under age, and carried herſelf very high, for ſhe knew well that the Protector was then afraid of a War with <hi>France,</hi> and that made the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Alliance more neceſſary to <hi>England:</hi> Yet the Council ſent for the Officers of her houſhold, and required them to let her
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170737:216"/>know that the Kings Authority was the ſame when he was a child as at full age; and that it was now lodged in them, and though as they were ſingle perſons, they were all inferiour to her, yet as they were the Kings Council, ſhe was bound to obey them, eſpecially when they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Law; which all Subjects of what rank ſoever were bound to obey. Yet at preſent they durſt go no further for fear of the Emperours diſpleaſure: So it was reſolved to connive at her Maſs.</p>
               <p>The Reformation of the greateſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in Divine Worſhip being thus eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed;
<note place="margin">Diſputes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts preſence in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> 
                  <hi>Cranmer</hi> proceeded next to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a form of Doctrine: the chief point that hitherto was untouched, was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, which the Prieſts magnified as the greateſt My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Chriſtian Religion, and the chief priviledge of Chriſtians; with which the ſimple and credulous vulgar were mightily affected. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> received that which had been for ſome Ages the Doctrine of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, that in the Sacraments there was both Bread and Wine, and alſo the ſubſtance of the Body and Blood of Chriſt. The <hi>Helvetians</hi> lookt on it only as a Commemoration of the Death of Chriſt. The Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> were at great pains to have theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, in which <hi>Bucer</hi> had laboured with great Induſtry: But <hi>Luther</hi> being a man of a harſh temper, did not eaſily bear contradiction, and was too apt to aſſume,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170737:217"/>in effect, that Infallibility to himſelf, which he condemned in the Pope. Some took a middle way, and aſſerted a Real Preſence, but it was not eaſie to underſtand what was meant by that expreſſion, unleſs it was a real application of Chriſts death; ſo that the meaning of <hi>Really</hi> was <hi>Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi> But though <hi>Bucer</hi> followed this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, <hi>Pet. Martyr</hi> did in his Lectures declare plainly for the <hi>Helvetians.</hi> So Dr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and ſome others, intended publickly to oppoſe and affront him; and challenged him to a diſpute about it, which he readily accepted, on theſe conditions, That the Kings Council ſhould firſt approve of it, and that it ſhould be managed in Scripture terms: For the ſtrength of thoſe Doctors lay in a nimble managing of thoſe barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and unintelligible terms of the Schools, which though they ſounded high, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they had no ſenſe under that: So all the Proteſtants reſolved to diſpute in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture terms, which ſeemed more proper in matters of Divinity, than the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical language of School men. The Council having appointed Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi> and ſome others, to preſide in the diſpute, Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> went out of the way, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after fled out of <hi>England:</hi> But before he went, he wrote a very mean ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to <hi>Cranmer:</hi> Other Doctors diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> concerning Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, but that had the common fate of all publick diſputes, for both ſides gave out that they had the better. At the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170737:217"/>ſame time there were alſo diſputes at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> which were moderated by <hi>Ridley,</hi> that was ſent down thither by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. He had fallen on <hi>Bertrams</hi> Book of the Sacrament, and wondred much to find ſo celebrated a Writer in the ninth Century, engage ſo plainly againſt the Corporal Preſence: This diſpoſed him to think that at that time it was not the received be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Church: He communicated the matter to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and they together made great Collections out of the Fathers on this head, and both wrote concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of their Arguments was,
<note place="margin" type="runSum">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Corporal Preſence.</note> That as Chriſt called the Cup <hi>the Fruit of the Vine,</hi> ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> called the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Bread,</hi> after the Conſecration; which ſhews that their natures were not changed. Chriſt ſpeaking to <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſubſtituting the Euchariſt in the room of the Paſchal Lamb, uſed ſuch expreſſions as had been cuſtomary among the <hi>Jews</hi> on that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; who called the <hi>Lamb</hi> the <hi>Lords Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> which could not be meant literally, ſince the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> was the Angels paſſing by their Houſes, when the firſt born of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were killed: So it being a commemoration of that, was called the <hi>Lords Paſſeover;</hi> and in the ſame ſenſe did Chriſt call the Bread <hi>his Body:</hi> Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative expreſſions being ordinary in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and not improper in Sacraments, which may be called Figurative actions. It was alſo appointed for a Remembrance
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170737:218"/>of Chriſt, and that ſuppoſes abſence: The Elements were alſo called by Chriſt his <hi>Body broken,</hi> and his <hi>Blood ſhed;</hi> ſo it is plain, they were his Body, not as it is glorified in Heaven, but as it ſuffered on the Croſs: And ſince the Scriptures ſpeak of Chriſts continuance in Heaven till the laſt day, from thence they infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he was not Corporally preſent. And it was ſhewed, that the <hi>eating Chriſts Fleſh,</hi> mentioned by S. <hi>John,</hi> was not to be underſtood of the Sacrament, ſince of every one that did eat, it is ſaid that he has <hi>Eternal life in him.</hi> So that was to be underſtood only of receiving Chriſts do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and he himſelf ſhewed it was to be meant ſo, when he ſaid, that <hi>the Fleſh profited nothing, but his words were Spirit and Life.</hi> So that all this was according to Chriſts ordinary way of teaching in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Many other Arguments were brought from the nature of a body, to prove that it could not be in more places than one at once, and that it was not in a place after the manner of a Spirit, but was always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. They found alſo that the Fathers had taught, that the Elements were ſtill Bread and Wine, and were the Types, the Signs and Figures of Chriſts Body, not only according to <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi> but to the Ancient Liturgies, both in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Churches. But that on which they built moſt, was that <hi>Chryſoſtome, Gelaſius,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> arguing againſt thoſe who ſaid that the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170737:218"/>humane nature in Chriſt was ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by its Union to his Godhead, They illuſtrated the contrary thus; as in the Sacrament, the Elements are united to the Body of Chriſt, and yet continue to be the ſame that they were formerly, both in Subſtance, Nature, and Figure; So the Humanity was not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its Union with the <hi>Word.</hi> From which it appeared that it was then the received opinion, that the Elements were not changed; and therefore all thoſe high expreſſions in <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> or others, were only ſtrains and figures of Eloquence, to raiſe the devotion of the people higher in that holy action. But upon thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the following Ages built that opinion, which agreeing ſo well with the Deſigns of the Prieſts, for eſtabliſhing the authority of that Order, which by its Character was qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for the greateſt performance that ever was; no wonder they took all imaginable pains to infuſe it into the belief of the world, and thoſe dark ages were diſpoſed to believe every thing ſo much the rather the more incredible that it appeared to be. In the ninth Century many of the greateſt men of that Age wrote againſt it, and none of them were for that condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Hereticks: The contrary opinion was then received in <hi>England,</hi> as appeared by one of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Homilies that was read on <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> in which many of <hi>Bertrams</hi> words were put. But it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received in the eleventh and twelfth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170737:219"/>Century, and fully eſtabliſhed in the fourth Council in the <hi>Lateran.</hi> At firſt it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the whole Loaf was turned into one entire Body, ſo that in the diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every one had a Joint given him; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that conceit, it was given out that it did often bleed, and was turned into pieces of Fleſh. But this ſeemed an undecent way of handling Chriſts glorified Body, ſo the School-men did invent a more ſeemly notion, That a Body might be in a place after the manner of a Spirit, ſo that in every crumb there was an entire Chriſt; which though it appeared very hard to be conceived, yet it generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and then the Miracles fitted for the former opinion were no more heard of, but new ones agreeing to this hypotheſis were ſet up in their ſtead. So dextrouſly did the Prieſts deceive the World; and becauſe a mouthful of Bread, or a draught of Wine, would have been ſhrewd tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to make the people think it was really Bread and Wine that they got, therefore as the Cup was taken away, ſo inſtead of Bread, a thin wafer was given, to make the People more eaſily imagine, that it was only the accidents of Bread, that were received by them. Upon theſe grounds did <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> go in this matter.</p>
               <p>There were ſome Anabaptiſts at this time in <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> that were come over out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi> of them there were two ſorts, ſome only objected to the baptizing of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170737:219"/>Children, and to the manner of it by ſprinkling, and not by dipping: others held many opinions, that had been anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently condemned as Hereſies: they had raiſed a cruel War in <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſet up a new King at <hi>Munſter,</hi> but all theſe carried the name Anabaptiſts from that of Infant-baptiſm, though it was one of the mildeſt Opinions that they held. Some of theſe came over to <hi>England,</hi> ſo a Commiſſion was granted to ſome Biſhops and others, to ſearch them out, and to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Several Perſons were brought before them, and did abjure their errors, which were, <q rend="inline">That there was not a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Perſons, that Chriſt was not God, and took not fleſh of the Virgin, and that a Regenerate man could not ſin.</q>
                  <note place="margin">Two were burnt.</note> One <hi>Joan Bocher,</hi> called <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that Chriſt took fleſh of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Mother; ſhe was out of meaſure vain and conceited of her noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and rejected all the Inſtruction that was offered her with ſcorn: ſo ſhe was condemned as an obſtinate Heretick, and delivered to the ſecular Arm. But it was very hard to perſwade the King to ſign the Warrant for her Execution; he thought it was an Inſtance of the ſame ſpirit of cruelty, for which the Reformers condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Papiſts: It was hard to condemn one to be burnt for ſome wild Opinions, eſpecially when they ſeemed to flow from a diſturbed brain; but <hi>Cranmer</hi> perſwaded him, that he being Gods Lieutenant, was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170737:220"/>bound in the firſt place to puniſh thoſe offences committed againſt God: He alſo alledged the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for puniſhing blaſphemers: and he thought errors that ſtruck immediately againſt the Apoſtles Creed, ought to be capitally puniſhed. Theſe things did rather ſilence than fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the young King: he ſigned the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant with tears in his eyes, and ſaid to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> that ſince he reſigned up himſelf in that matter to his judgment, if he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it, it ſhould lie at his door. This ſtruck the Archbiſhop: and both he, and <hi>Ridley</hi> took her into their Houſes, and tried what reaſon, joyned with gentleneſs, could do. But ſhe was ſtill more and more Inſolent, ſo at laſt ſhe was burnt, and ended her life very indecently, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out often in jeers, and reproaches, and was looked on as a perſon fitter for <hi>Bedlam,</hi> than a Stake. Some time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, a Dutchman, <hi>George van Parre,</hi> was alſo condemned and burnt, for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divinity of Chriſt, and ſaying, that the Father only was God. He had led a very Exemplary life, both for faſting, devotion, and a good converſation, and ſuffer'd with extraordinary compoſedneſs of mind. Theſe things caſt a great blemiſh on the Reformers: It was ſaid, they only condemned cruelty, when it was exerciſed on themſelves, but were ready to practiſe it, when they had power. The Papiſts made great uſe of this afterwards in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, and what <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:170737:220"/>ſuffered in her time, was thought a juſt retaliation on them from that wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that diſpenſes all things juſtly to all Men. For the other ſort of Anabaptiſts, no ſeverities were uſed againſt them, but ſeveral Books were written to juſtifie In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm; and the Practice of the Church ſo early begun, and ſo univerſally ſpread, was thought a good Plea, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being grounded on ſuch Arguments in Scripture, as did demonſtrate, at leaſt, the lawfulneſs of it.</p>
               <p>Another ſort of People was much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of,
<note place="margin">The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed.</note> who built ſo much on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Opinion of Predeſtination, that they thought they might live as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; ſince nothing could reſiſt an abſolute Decree: nor did thoſe who had advanced that Opinion, know well how to hinder People, from making ſuch Inferences from it; all they did, was to warn them, not to pry too much into thoſe ſecrets: but if the Opinion was true, there was no need of much prying to make ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions from it. This had a very ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on the Lives of many, who thought they were ſet looſe from all obligations: and that was indeed the greateſt ſcandal of the Reformation. The Preachers were aware of it, and apprehenſive of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, that would follow on it: of which they gave the Nation free warning.</p>
               <p>At this time a ſort of Contagion of rage run over all the Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tumults in ſeveral parts of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> The Nobility and Gentry finding
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170737:221"/>more advantage by the Trade of Wool, than by their Corn, did generally incloſe their Grounds, and turn them to Paſture: and ſo kept but few Servants, and took large Portions of their Eſtates into their own hands: and yet the numbers of the People increaſed, Marriage being allowed to all; the abrogation of many Holy-days, and the putting down of Pilgrimages, gave them alſo more time to work. So the Commons feared to be reduced to great ſlavery. Some propoſed an <hi>Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Law, for regulating this, and the King himſelf wrote a Diſcourſe about it, that there might be ſome equality in the diviſion of the ſoyl among the Tenants. The Protector was a great friend to the Commons, and complained much of the Oppreſſion of the Landlords. There was a Commiſſion iſſued out, to enquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Incloſures and Farms, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe who purchaſed the <hi>Abbey</hi> Lands, and were obliged to keep up Hoſpitality, performed it, or not? and what encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement they gave to Husbandry? but this turned to nothing. So the Commons roſe every where, yet in moſt of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Counties, they were eaſily diſperſed; and it was promiſed that their grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould be redreſſed. The Protector againſt the Councils mind, ſet out a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation againſt all new Incloſures, and for indemnifying the People, for what was paſt. Commiſſioners were alſo ſent every where, to hear and determine all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170737:221"/>but the power that was given to them, was ſo arbitrary, that the Landlords cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it an Invaſion of Property, when their Rights were thus ſubjected to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſuch Men. The Commons under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the Protector was ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to them, were thereby the more encouraged: and it was afterwards obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to him, that the Convulſions <hi>England</hi> fell in, ſoon after, was chiefly occaſioned by his ill Conduct; in which he was the more blamed, becauſe he acted againſt the mind of the greateſt part of the Council.
<note place="margin">The Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in <hi>Devonſhire.</hi> June 10.</note> In <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> the Inſurrection was more formidable; the ſuperſtition of the Prieſts joining with the rage of the Commons, ſo they became quickly 10000. ſtrong. The Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was ſent againſt them with a ſmall force, and was ordered to try, if the matter could be compoſed without blood: but <hi>Arundel,</hi> a Man of Quality, commanding the Rebels, they were not a looſe body of People, eaſily diſſipated. They ſent their Demands to Court, <q rend="inline">That the old Service and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies might be ſet up again, that the Act of the ſix Articles, and the Decrees of General Councils might be again in force: that the Bible in <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould be called in, that Preachers ſhould pray for the Souls in Purgatory, that Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> ſhould be reſtored, that the half of the <hi>Abbey</hi> Lands ſhould be reſtored, to found two <hi>Abbeys</hi> in every County, and that Gentlemen of 100. Marks a Year,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170737:222"/>might have but one Servant:</q> and they deſired a ſafe Conduct for their Chief Leaders, in order to the Redreſs of their particular Grievances: afterwards they moderated their deſires, only to points of Religion. <hi>Cranmer</hi> writ a large Anſwer to theſe, ſhewing the Novelty and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of thoſe Rites and Ceremonies, and of that whole way of worſhip, of which they were ſo fond: and that the amendments and changes had been made, according to the Scriptures, and the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the Primitive Church: and that their being fond of a Worſhip, which they underſtood not, and being deſirous to be kept ſtill in ignorance, without the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, ſhewed their Prieſts had greater power over them, than the common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all Mankind had: as for the ſix Articles, that Act had never paſt, if the King had not gone in Perſon to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and argued for it: yet he ſoon ſaw his error, and was ſlack in executing it. After that there was a high threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Anſwer ſent them in the King's name, charging them for their Rebellion, and blind obedience to their Prieſts. In it the King's authority, under Age, was largely ſet forth, for by the pretence of the Kings Minority, the People generally were made believe, that their riſing in Arms, was not Rebellion. In Concluſion, they were earneſtly invited to ſubmit to the Kings mercy, as others had done, whom the King had not only pardoned,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170737:222"/>but had redreſſed their juſt Grievances. At the ſame time the like ſpirit of rage inflamed the Commons in <hi>Norfolk;</hi> they pretended nothing of Religion,

                  </note> but only to deſtroy the Gentry, and put new Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors about the King: they were led by one <hi>Ket</hi> a Tanner, and in a few days grew to be 20000. They encamped near <hi>Norwich,</hi> and committed great out-rages: <hi>Parker,</hi> afterwards Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> went in among them, and with great freedom inveighed againſt their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Cruelty, and warned them of the Judgments of God that would fall on them, for which he was in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life. <hi>Ket</hi> was now their Prince, and in imitation of the ancient <hi>Druids,</hi> he did Juſtice upon complaints brought before him, under an Oak called from thence the <hi>Oak of Reformation.</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Northampton</hi> was ſent againſt them, with Orders to keep at a diſtance, and cut off their proviſions. There was at the ſame time a riſing likewiſe in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> where the Commons being incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by ſome pretended Prophecies run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and committed acts of great bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity on ſome Gentlemen.
<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> begin a War.</note> The <hi>French</hi> King hearing of all this, reſolved to take his advantage, and regain <hi>Bulloigne:</hi> three days before he marched with his Army, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſadour preſſing him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Intimations that were given him of his deſigns, he aſſured him on the faith of a Gentleman, that he would not begin a

But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes reckon it a part of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, to be exempted from ſuch ties, by which only poor Subjects ought to be fettered. All theſe things falling upon the Government at once; it may be eaſily imagined, they were under no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation. A Faſt was proclaimed at Court, where <hi>Cranmer</hi> preached with great freedom and vehemence: he laid out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them their vitious and ill lives, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of thoſe who pretended a love to the Goſpel; and ſet before them the Judgments of God that they might look for, and inlarged on the freſh example of the Calamities of <hi>Germany;</hi> and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the ſad apprehenſions he had of ſome terrible ſtroke, if they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and amend their lives.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where routed.</note> the Citizens reſiſted their aſſaults, but could not ſo eaſily reſiſt the aſſaults that hunger made on them, for they were not provided for a Siege. They were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at laſt to great extremities, which made the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> after he had got ſuch ſupplies, as he judged neceſſary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to fall upon them. They poſſeſſed themſelves of a Bridge behind him, both to incloſe him, and to hinder others from joyning with him; but he marched back, and did quickly beat them from it, with the loſs of 600. of their Men: and by that eſſay he perceived how eaſie a work it would be to diſperſe them: he upon
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170737:223"/>that marched forward to <hi>Exeter;</hi> and beat the Rebels from a Bridge, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened his way to their Camp, killing a 1000. of them: upon which they raiſed the Siege, and retired in great diſorder to <hi>Lanceſton:</hi> he purſued them, as long as they kept in a body, and great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them were killed, ſome of their Leaders and Prieſts were taken and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So happily was that Rebellion ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without any loſs on the Kings ſide. But the Marqueſs of <hi>Northampton</hi> was not ſo ſucceſsful in <hi>Norfolk:</hi> he marched into <hi>Norwich.</hi> The Rebels having a great Party in the Town, which was a place of no ſtrength, fell in upon him next day, and drove him out of it: 100. of his Men were killed, and thirty taken Priſoners. Upon this they were much lifted up, but the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> coming thither with 6000. Men, that were prepared to be ſent to <hi>Scotland,</hi> they, after ſome skirmiſhes with him, were forced to retire, for they had waſted all the Countrey about, ſo, that their Proviſions failed them: but <hi>Warwick</hi> followed them cloſe, and killed great numbers, and diſperſed them. <hi>Ket,</hi> and ſome of their Leaders were taken, and hanged in Chains. The news of this going to <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> the Rebels there that had not exceeded 3000. accepted the offer of pardon, that was ſent them; and ſome of the more factious, that were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating them, to make new commotions, were taken and hanged. On the 21. of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170737:224"/>
                  <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Protector publiſhed a General Pardon, in the Kings name, of all that had been done before that day. Many of the Council oppoſed this, and judged it better to keep the Commons under the laſh; but the Protector thought, that as long as ſuch Members continued in ſuch fears, it would be eaſie to raiſe new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders: ſo he reſolved, though without the Majority of the Council, to go through with it. This diſguſted the Council ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, who thought he took too much upon him.</p>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ridley</hi> was the chief of the Viſitors: When he found that a deſign was laid to ſuppreſs ſome Colledges, under pretence of uniting them to others, and to convert ſome Fellowſhips that were provided for Divines, to the ſtudy of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law, he refuſed to go along in that with the other Viſitors; and particularly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the ſuppreſſion of <hi>Clare</hi> Hall, which they began with. He ſaid, the Church was already too much robbed, and yet ſome Mens ravenouſneſs was not ſatisfied. It ſeemed the deſign was laid, to drive both Religion and Learning out of the Land; therefore he deſired leave to be gone. The Viſitors complained of him to the Protector, and imputed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for <hi>Clare</hi>-Hall to his partiality for the North, where he was born, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Houſe for the Northern Counties. Upon that, the Protector wrote him a chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170737:224"/>Letter, but he anſwered it with the freedom that became a Biſhop, who was reſolved to ſuffer all things, rather than ſin againſt his Conſcience: and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector was ſo well ſatisfied with him, that the Colledge was preſerved. There was at this time an end put to a very fooliſh Controverſie, that had occaſioned ſome heat, concerning the pronunciation of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue; which many uſed more ſuitably to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> than a <hi>Greek</hi> accent. <hi>Cheek</hi> being the Profeſſor of <hi>Greek,</hi> had taught the truer Rules of Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, but <hi>Gardiner</hi> was an Enemy to every thing that was new, and ſo he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it much in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s time: and <hi>Cheek</hi> was made leave the Chair: but both he, and Sir <hi>Tho. Smith</hi> wrote in Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of his Rules, with ſo much Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that all People wondred to ſee ſo much brought out upon ſo ſlight an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; but <hi>Gardiner</hi> was not a Man to be wrought on by reaſon. Now the matter was ſetled, and the new way of pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation took place, and that the rather, becauſe the Patrons of it were in ſuch power, the one being the King's Tutor, and the other made Secretary of State: and that <hi>Gardiner,</hi> who oppoſed it, was now in the <hi>Tower.</hi> So great an Influence has Greatneſs, in ſupporting the moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative and indifferent things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bonner</hi> was now brought in trouble:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bonners</hi> Proceſs.</note> It was not eaſie to know how to deal with him, for he obeyed every Order that was
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170737:225"/>ſent him; and yet it was known that he ſecretly hated and condemned all that was done; and as often as he could declare that ſafely, he was not wanting by ſuch ways to preſerve his intereſt with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts: And though he obeyed the Orders of Council, yet he did it in ſo remiſs a manner, that it was viſible that it went againſt the grain.
<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> So he was called before the Council, and charged with ſeveral particulars, That whereas he uſed to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate himſelf on the great Feſtivals, he had not done it ſince the New Service was ſet out; that he took no care to repreſs Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and that he never Preached. So they ordered him to officiate every Feſtival, to Preach once a quarter, and to begin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three weeks, and Preach at S. <hi>Pauls;</hi> and to be preſent at every Sermon when he was in health, and to proceed ſeverely againſt thoſe who withdrew from the new Service, and againſt Adulterers. They required him to ſet forth the heinouſneſs of Rebellion, and the nature of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the indifference of outward Ceremonies, and particularly to declare that the Kings Authority was the ſame, and as much to be obeyed before he was of age as after. On the firſt of <hi>September</hi> he Preacht; he ſaid nothing of the power of Kings under Age, and ſpoke but little to the other points; but enlarged much on the Corporal Preſence in the Sacrament. <hi>Hooper,</hi> and <hi>W. Latimer,</hi> two of his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, informed againſt him. So a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170737:225"/>was granted to <hi>Cranmer, Ridley,</hi> the two Secretaries of State, and <hi>May,</hi> Dean of S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> to examine that matter, and to impriſon, or deprive him, as they ſhould ſee cauſe for it: They were alſo authorized to proceed in the ſummary way of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Courts. He was ſummoned to <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> where he carried himſelf with great diſreſpect and diſingenuity towards the Delegates; and gave the Inſormers very ſoul language; and in his whole diſcourſe he behaved himſelf like one that was diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Brain. When the Commiſſion was read, he made a Proteſtation againſt it, reſerving to himſelf power to except to diverſe things in it. He ſaid the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers were Hereticks, and only proſecuted him becauſe he had taught the preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament. At the next meeting Secretary <hi>Smith</hi> was there, who was not preſent at the firſt: So upon that account, <hi>Bonner</hi> proteſted againſt him, he alſo charged Hereſie on his Accuſers, who were thereby under Excommunication, and ſo not capable to appear in any Court. He denied that any Injunctions had been given him under the Kings hand or Signet; he ſaid he had preached againſt the late Rebels, which implied that the Kings power was compleat, though he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age. It was anſwered to this, that the Court might proceed <hi>ex Officio,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Informers: And that the Injunctions, concerning the heads of which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to treat in his Sermon, were read
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170737:226"/>to him by one of the Secretaries, and were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by the Protector, and they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards called for, and that Article about the Kings power under age was, by Order of Council, added; and the Paper was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him by Secretary <hi>Smith.</hi> At a third appearance the Informers offered to vindicate themſelves of the charge of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie; but after ſome ſcurrilous language given them by <hi>Bonner,</hi> he was called upon to anſwer to the main buſineſs, which was, his ſaying nothing of the Kings power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age; to this he ſaid, he had prepared notes about it, both from the Inſtances in Scripture, of <hi>Solomon, Joaſh</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> of <hi>Joſiah</hi> and <hi>Joakim,</hi> that reigned under age; as alſo ſeveral inſtances in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> ſtory, as <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth; but he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe things had eſcaped his memory; and a long account of the defeat of the Rebels being ſent to him by the Council, with an Order to read it, had put him in ſome confuſion, and that the Book in which he had put his Notes, fell from him; for which he appealed to his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, whom he had imployed to gather for him the names of thoſe Kings who had reigned before they were of age. But this did not ſatisfie the Court, ſo they proceeded to examine Witneſſes, whom <hi>Bonner</hi> intangled all he could with Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories, and the niceties of the Canon Law. <hi>Bonner</hi> built his main defence on
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170737:226"/>this, that in the Paper which the Protector gave him, that Article concerning the Kings age was not mentioned, but was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards added by <hi>Smith;</hi> ſo that he was not bound to obey it: But it was proved that the whole Council ordered that addition to be made. <hi>Smith</hi> had treated him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſharply, for his carriage was very provoking; upon that, he renewed his former Proteſtation againſt him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to look on him as his Judge, ſince he had declared himſelf ſo partial againſt him: He complained, that <hi>Smith</hi> had compared him to Thieves and Traytors. <hi>Smith</hi> ſaid it was viſible he acted as they did: To which <hi>Bonner</hi> anſwered, that as he was Secretary of State he honoured him, but as he was Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> he <hi>lied,</hi> and he <hi>defied him.</hi> And being threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Impriſonment, he ſeemed not much concerned at it; he ſaid he had a few Goods, a poor Carkaſs, and a Soul; the two former were in their power, but he would take care of the latter. And upon that he appealed to the King, and would not anſwer any more, unleſs <hi>Smith</hi> ſhould withdraw: For that contempt he was ſent to the <hi>Marſhalſea;</hi> but as he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, he broke out into great paſſion both againſt <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Cranmer.</hi> Being called again before them, he adhered to his former Appeal, and ſome new matter being brought againſt him, he refuſed to anſwer. Great endeavours were uſed to perſwade him to ſubmit, and promiſes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170737:227"/>were made him of gentler uſage for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but he continued obſtinate, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of retracting, he renewed his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal.
<note place="margin">And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation.</note> So on the firſt of <hi>October, Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Ridley, Smith</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> pronounced ſentence of deprivation, becauſe he had not obeyed the Orders of the Protector and Council, nor declared the Kings power while he was under age. He was ſent back to priſon till the King ſhould give further Order, and a large Record was made of his whole deportment during the Proceſs, and put in the Regiſter of the See of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which he took no care to deface when he was afterwards reſtored. This was much cenſured, as at beſt a great ſtretch of Law, if not plainly contrary to it. Some complained that Lay-men concurred in ſuch a Sentence: But it was ſaid this was no Spiritual Cenſure, for he was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded, but only deprived of his Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick; and he had taken a Commiſſion for holding it during the Kings pleaſure, and ſo thoſe that were Commiſſioned by the King might well deprive him, ſince he held it ſo precariouſly. It was alſo ſaid that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> had appointed Triers for hearing the Complaints made of ſome Biſhops; and they examined the buſineſs of <hi>Cecilian</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> upon an Appeal from ſome Synods, that had before judged that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. That ſame Emperour did alſo by his own authority, turn out the Patriarchs of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> And though the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170737:227"/>party complained of his doing it upon the falſe ſuggeſtions of the <hi>Arians,</hi> yet they did not deny his authority in ſuch caſes: And it was ordinary for the Emperours to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Biſhops that followed their Court to judge ſome other Biſhops, which was not done Canonically, but by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours authority. But to the matter of the Sentence, it was alſo ſaid that it was hard to deprive <hi>Bonner</hi> for an omiſſion, that might be only a defect of his memory, as he pretended it was, though few believed that. Upon the whole matter, it was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that it had been reſolved to turn him out on the firſt occaſion that could be found, and that they took hold of him on this diſadvantage, and that the fault was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aggravated for his ſake, than he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived for the fault, which would have been more gently paſt over in another; but he had been fierce and cruel, and ſo was much hated, and little pitied. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a Priſoner till Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, but continued to behave himſelf more like a Glutton than a Divine; for he ſent about to his Friends to furniſh him well with Puddings and Pears, and gave them all to the Devil that did not ſupply him liberally: Such Curſes were ſtrange acts of Epiſcopal Juriſdiction; yet they were mild, compared to thoſe he gave out when he was again reſtored to his See in the next Reign, by which he condemned ſo many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents to the fire.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> affairs in Foreign parts went very unſucceſsfully this year,
<note place="margin">Ill ſucceſs of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh.</hi>
                  </note> for when they
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170737:228"/>were ſo diſtracted at home, no wonder if both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> took advantage from thence. Moſt of the Forts about <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loigne</hi> were taken by the <hi>French,</hi> but though thoſe that commanded them, did for their own excuſe, pretend they were ill provided, yet the <hi>French</hi> Writers publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they were well ſtored. From theſe they came and ſat down before <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> and though the Plague broke into the <hi>French</hi> Camp, yet the Siege was not rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: The King left the Army under the Command of <hi>Coligny,</hi> the famous Admiral of <hi>France.</hi> He found the ſure way to take it, was to cut it off from Sea, and ſo to keep out all Supplies: But the ſeveral at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts he made to do that proved unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The Winter that came on, forced him to raiſe the Siege; but he lodged a great part of his Army in the Forts about, ſo that it was in danger of being loſt next year. In <hi>Scotland</hi> there was alſo a great turn; the Caſtle of <hi>Broughty</hi> was taken by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Garriſon almoſt wholly cut off. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> took care to provide <hi>Hading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> well, expecting a Siege; but upon that the <hi>Scots</hi> let it alone; yet the charge of keeping it was ſo great, and the Countrey about it was ſo waſted, that all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions were to be ſent from <hi>Berwick,</hi> ſo that the Protector thought it more adviſable to abandon it; and upon that, ſent orders to the Garriſon to ſlight the works, and come back to <hi>England.</hi> So that now the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had no place beyond the Borders, except <hi>Lander:</hi> and <hi>Thermes</hi> the <hi>French</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:170737:228"/>General ſat down before it, and if a Peace had not come, it had fallen into his hands. The Protector had now no Foreign Ally to depend on but the Emperour; and little was to be expected from him, for he was ſo diſſatisfied with the changes that had been made in the matters of Religion, that they found his aſſiſtance was not to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to. At this time the Emperour brought his Son to the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> that he might put him in poſſeſſion of thoſe Provinces; though the ſecret conſiderations that made him do it ſo early, in thoſe places where the Prince was not Elective, is not viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It was thought they enclined to ſhake off his yoke, and that if the Emperour ſhould have then died, they would have put themſelves under <hi>Maximilian, Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>'s Son, afterwards Emperour. It was ſome ſuch apprehenſion that moved <hi>Charles</hi> to make them ſwear obedience ſo early to his Son; and ſettle not only many limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on him in the matter of impoſing Taxes, and of not putting ſtrangers in places of truſt, not governing them by a Military power, but make a ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, that in caſe his Son ſhould break thoſe rules, the Provinces ſhould not be bound to obey him any longer: Which was the chief ground both in Law and Conſcience, upon which they afterwards juſtified their ſhaking off his yoke. <hi>Charles,</hi> that was born in thoſe parts, had a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar tenderneſs for them, and did perhaps fear that the rigid Councils of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:170737:229"/>might prevail too much on his Son, which made him ſo careful to ſecure their liberties; a rare inſtance of a Princes love for his people, by which he took ſuch care of their rights, as to make their tye of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Son, to depend on his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them inviolably. The Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> were now at the Emperours mercy, and ſaw no way to recover their liberty but by the help of the <hi>French</hi> King: So there were applications made to him, which he cheerfully entertained, only he was reſolved firſt to make himſelf maſter of <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> and then to turn his whole force towards <hi>Germany.</hi> Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were given of this to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, upon which he entred into a deep conſultation with his Friends what was fit to be done in ſo critical a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture; whether it was better to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up <hi>Bulloigne</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> by a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or to engage in a War to preſerve it; which being on the <hi>French</hi> ſide, would prove a much more chargeable War to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> than to the <hi>French;</hi> and this was of very dangerous conſequence when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were in ſo unſetled a condition at home; ill ſucceſs, which was like to be the event of ſuch a War, would turn on him that had the chief adminiſtration of affairs: ſo both regard to the publick, and to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing his private fortune, which could not be done in time of War, without drawing much envy on him, inclined him to deliver up <hi>Bulloigne.</hi> But his Enemies ſaw that the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170737:229"/>continuance of the War was like to ruine him, whereas a General Peace would put the Nation wholly in his hands, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who were the majority in the Council, ſet themſelves againſt all motions for a Treaty; and ſaid it would be a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting reproach on the Government if ſuch a place as <hi>Bulloigne</hi> were ſold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paget</hi> gave his opinion in Writing,
<note place="margin">Several expedients propoſed.</note> in which, after he had with great Judgement ballanced the affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the reſtoring the liberty of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and the bearing down the Emperours greatneſs, was at preſent to be preferred to all other things, and that could not be done without a conjunction with <hi>France;</hi> and that was to be purſued by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Venetians. Thomas,</hi> a Clerk of the Council, and much imployed in foreign affairs, was of another mind: He thought it was very diſhonourable to deliver up the late Conqueſts in <hi>France,</hi> therefore he propoſed their caſting themſelves on the Emperour, that ſo ſome time might be gained: They knew the Emperour would not be hearty, unleſs they would promiſe to return to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion; but he thought that was to be done in ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of affairs; and when the preſent difficulty was over, they might turn to other Councils. There was great danger in this, it would very much diſhearten the few Towns that refuſed to bear the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours yoke in <hi>Germany,</hi> and it would provoke the Emperour more againſt them

               <p>The iſſue of theſe Conſultations,
<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes his aſſiſtance.</note> was, firſt, the ſending over <hi>Paget</hi> to the Emperor, to try what might be expected from him: His publick Inſtructions were to obtain an explanation of ſome ambiguous words in the former Treaty, and a ratification of it by Prince <hi>Philip,</hi> and to adjuſt ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the matter of Trade: but his ſecret Inſtructions were to ſee, if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror would include <hi>Bulloign</hi> in the League defenſive, and ſo protect it: or, if that could not be obtained, he was ordered to try, whether the Emperour would take <hi>Bulloign</hi> into his hands, and what recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence he would give for it; but this he was ordered to propoſe as a motion of his own. The Emperour ſhifted him off for ſome time by delays, and pretended that the carrying his Son about from Town to Town, making them ſwear o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, took him up ſo, that till that was over, he could not receive his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. But the Progreſs of the <hi>French</hi> about <hi>Bulloign,</hi> made <hi>Paget</hi> impatient, ſo the Biſhop of <hi>Arras,</hi> and the Emperour's other Miniſters were appointed to treat with him. They at firſt treated of ſome
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170737:230"/>differences between the Courts of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty of both ſides, and propoſed ſome Expedients for adjuſting them: for the Confirmation of the Treaty, it was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Prince ſhould do it, but <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi> moved likewiſe, that it might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the States. It was anſwered, that the Emperor would never ſue to his Subjects to confirm his Treaties: he had fifteen or ſixteen Parliaments, and would be in a very uneaſie condition, if all theſe muſt know the ſecrets of his Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But ſince the King of <hi>England</hi> was under Age, it was more reaſonable for them to demand a ratification from his Parliament. <hi>Paget</hi> anſwered, the King's power was the ſame at all Ages, and a ratification under the Great Seal did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him, as much, as if he had made the Treaty himſelf: and objected, that their laſt Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> was ratified by the Aſſembly of the States. To this they anſwered, that the Prerogative of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> was ſo limited, that they could not alienate any thing, which belonged to the Crown, without conſent of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of the States; but the Emperor had a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited power in making Treaties. As for the buſineſs of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Arras</hi> ſaid, it was taken after the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Treaty with <hi>England,</hi> and ſo was not included in it, nor could the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror comprehend it within it, without breach of his Faith and Treaties with <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:170737:231"/>which was ſo contrary to the Emperor's honour, that it could not be done. For the honour of a Prince is a good excuſe, when he has no mind to engage in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful or unjuſt War, but it is often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, when the Circumſtances are more favourable. <hi>Paget,</hi> after ſeveral other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, found there was nothing more to be expected of the Emperor: ſo he returned back to <hi>England.</hi> It was upon that propoſed in Council, whether ſince by the Treaty with <hi>France, Bulloign</hi> was to be delivered up within a few Years, it were not better to prevent a new War and a Siege, the iſſue of which was like to prove very dangerous, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Treaty for doing it preſently; and if at the ſame time it were not more adviſable to make an end of the War in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſince there was no poſſibility of compaſſing the Marriage, for which it was firſt begun.</p>
               <p>Upon this,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> Faction againſt the Protector.</note> all the Protector's Enemies took off the Mask, and declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt it. The Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> were the chief ſticklers: the one hated him for turning him out of his Office, and the other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to be the chief Man in buſineſs, if he ſhould fall. Many things concurred to raiſe the Protector many Enemies, his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality to the Commons provoked the Gentry, his cutting off his Brothers head, and building a Magnificent Palace in the <hi>Strand,</hi> upon the ruines of ſome Biſhops
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170737:231"/>Houſes and Churches, and that in a time both of War and Plague, diſguſted the People. The Clergy hated him, not only for his promoting the changes made in Religion, but for his poſſeſſing himſelf of ſo many of the Biſhops beſt Mannors: his entertaining foreign Troops, both <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> though done by the conſent of Council, yet gave a general diſtaſt: and that great advancement he was raiſed to, wrought much, both on himſelf and others; for it raiſed his pride, as much as it provoked the envy of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: The Privy Counſellors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that he was become ſo Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his proceedings, that he little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the oppoſition that was made by the Majority of the Council, to any of his deſigns. All theſe things concurred, to beget him many Enemies: and except <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who never forſook his friend, and <hi>Paget</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> all turned againſt him: ſo they violently oppoſed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, for a Treaty with <hi>France:</hi> they alſo complained, that the Places about <hi>Bulloign</hi> were loſt by his careleſneſs, and by his not providing them well, and that he had recalled the Garriſon out of <hi>Hading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> and they put him in mind of the conditions, upon which he was firſt made Protector, by which he was limited to do nothing, but by their advice; though he had ſince that, taken out a Patent, which cloathed him with a far greater power. Upon <hi>Pagets</hi> return, when it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170737:232"/>was viſible, that nothing could be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Emperor, he preſt them much to conſent to a Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> but it was ſaid, that he had ſecretly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <hi>Paget</hi> to procure no better anſwer, that ſo he might be furniſhed with an excuſe, for ſo diſhonourable an Action, therefore they would not give way to it.</p>
               <p>The Protector carried the King to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court,
<note place="margin">Which turns to a publick breach. <hi>October.</hi>
                  </note> and put many of his own Creatures about him, which increaſed the Jealouſies, ſo Nine of the Privy Council met at <hi>Ely</hi>-Houſe, and aſſumed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Authority of the Council; and Secretary <hi>Petre</hi> being ſent by the King, to ask an account of their meeting, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of returning, joyned himſelf to them. They made a large Declaration of the Protector's ill government and bad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and of his engaging the King to ſet his hand to Letters, for raiſing Men, and for diſperſing Seditious Papers; therefore they reſolved to ſee to the ſafety of the King and Kingdom. Both the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> declared for them: They alſo ſent Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters all over <hi>England,</hi> deſiring the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Nobility and Gentry. Seven more Privy Counſellors came and joyned with them. They wrote to the King, complaining of the Protector's obſtinacy, and his refuſing to hearken to their Counſels, though the late King had left the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Perſon and Kingdom to them
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170737:232"/>in common, and the Protector was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to that dignity by them, upon conditions which he had little regarded; therefore they deſired the King would conſtruct well of their Intentions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. The Protector had removed the King from <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, as being an open place, to <hi>Windſor,</hi> which had ſome more defence about it; and had armed ſome of his own Servants, and ſet them about the King's Perſon, which heightned the Jealouſies of him; yet ſeeing himſelf aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by all friends, except a few, and finding the Party againſt him, was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch a ſtrength, that it would be in vain to ſtruggle any longer, he offered to ſubmit himſelf to the Council: So a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a Treaty was ſet on foot; and the Lords at <hi>London</hi> were deſired to ſend two of their number with their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and a Paſſeport was ſent them for their ſafety. <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and the other two writ to the Council, to diſpoſe them to an agreement, and not to follow <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Counſels.</hi> Many falſe reports, as is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al on ſuch occaſions, were carried of the Protector, as if he had threatned, that if they intended to put him to death, the King ſhould dye firſt, which ſerved to increaſe the prejudices againſt him. The Council writ to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and <hi>Paget</hi> charging them to look well to the Kings Perſon, that he ſhould not be removed from <hi>Windſor,</hi> and that the Duke of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet</hi>'s Servants might be put from him,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170737:233"/>and his own ſworn Servants admitted to wait: they alſo proteſted that they would proceed with all the moderation and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour towards the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> that was poſſible. The Council underſtanding that all things were prepared, as they had deſired, ſent firſt three of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to ſee that the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and ſome of his Creatures, <hi>Smith, Stanhop, Thynne, Wolf</hi> and <hi>Cecil</hi> ſhould be confined to their Lodgings; and on the 12th. of <hi>October,</hi> the whole Council went to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and made great proteſtations of their duty to the King, which he received favourably, and aſſured them he took all that they had done in good part.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> with the reſt of his friends,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>'s fall.</note> except <hi>Cecil,</hi> who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently inlarged, were ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and many Articles were objected to him, That he being made Protector, with this condition, that he ſhould do nothing, but by the conſent of the other Executors, had treated with Ambaſſadours apart, had made Biſhops and Lord-Lieutenants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their knowledge, had held a Court of Requeſts in his Houſe, had embaſed the Coin, had neglected the Places the King had in <hi>France,</hi> had encouraged the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in their late Inſurrections, and had given out Commiſſions, and proclaimed a Pardon without their conſent: that he had animated the King againſt the reſt of the Council, and had proclaimed them Traitors, &amp; had put his own Servants armed
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170737:233"/>about the King's Perſon. By theſe, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the Crimes againſt him were the effects of his ſudden exaltation, that had made him too much forget that he was a ſubject, but that he had carried his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with much Innocence, ſince no acts of Cruelty, Rapine, or Bribery, were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to him: for they were rather er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and weakneſſes than Crimes. His em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing the Coin was done upon a common miſtake of weak Governments, who flye to that as their laſt refuge, in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of their affairs. In his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſet himſelf to the ſtudy of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy and Divinity, and writ a Preface to a Book of Patience, which had made great Impreſſions on him. His fall was a great affliction to all that loved the Reformation, and that was increaſed, becauſe they had no reaſon to truſt much to the two chief Men of the party againſt him, <hi>Southampton</hi> and <hi>Warwick:</hi> the one was a known Papiſt, and the other was lookt on as a Man of no Religion: and both at the Emperor's Court, and in <hi>France,</hi> it was expected, that upon this revolution, matters of Religion would be again ſet back, into the poſture, in which King <hi>Henry</hi> had left them. The Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> and <hi>Gardiner</hi> hoped to be diſcharged, and <hi>Bonner</hi> lookt to be re-eſtabliſhed in his Biſhoprick again, and all People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fall off much from the new ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: but the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> finding the King was zealouſly addicted to the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170737:234"/>Reformation, quickly forſook the Popiſh party, and ſeemed to be a mighty promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that work. A Court of Civilians was appointed to examine <hi>Bonner</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, and upon their report the Council rejected it, and confirmed the Sentence that was paſt upon him.</p>
               <p>But next,
<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror will not aſſiſt them.</note> foreign affairs come under their care. They ſuſpected that <hi>Paget</hi> had not dealt effectually with the Emperour, to aſſiſt them in the preſervation of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loign;</hi> ſo they ſent over Sir <hi>Tho. Cheyney,</hi> to try what might be expected from him: they took alſo care of the Garriſon, and both encreaſed it, and ſupplied it well. <hi>Cheyney</hi> found the ſame reception with the Emperour, and had the ſame anſwer that <hi>Paget</hi> got. The Emperor preſt him much, that matters of Religion might be again conſidered, and confeſt, that till that were done, he could not aſſiſt them ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as otherwiſe he would do: ſo now the Council found it neceſſary to apply to the Court of <hi>France</hi> for a Peace. The Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi> left the Court in great diſcontent, he was neither reſtored to his Office of Chancellour, nor was he made one of the ſix Lords, that were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have the charge of the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; this touched him ſo much, that he died not long after of grief, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
               <p>In <hi>November,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> a Seſſion of Parliament met: in which an Act was paſt, declaring it Treaſon to call any to the number of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170737:234"/>Twelve together, about any matter of State, if being required, they did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe themſelves: other Riotous Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies were alſo declared felonious, the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out of Prophecies concerning the King, or Council, was alſo made Penal. Another Law was made againſt Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, the former Statute was repealed, as too ſevere, and Proviſions were made for the relief of the Sick and Impotent, and Imploying ſuch as could work. The Biſhops made a heavy complaint of the growth of Vice and Impiety, and that their power was ſo much abridged, that they could not repreſs it: ſo a Bill was read, enlarging their Authority, but it was thought, that it gave them too much power; yet it was ſo moderated, that the Lords paſt it. But the Commons reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: and inſtead of it, ſent up a Bill, that impowered XXXII. who were to be named by the King, the one half of the Temporalty, and the other of Spiritualty, to compile a body of Eccleſiaſtical Laws within three years, and that theſe, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the Common or Statute Law, and approved of by the King, ſhould have the force of Eccleſiaſtical Laws: of the 32. Four were to be Biſhops, and as many to be Common Lawyers.</p>
               <p>Six Biſhops and ſix Divines were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to prepare a new form of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1550"/> which being confirmed under the Great Seal, ſhould take place after <hi>April</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:170737:235"/>next. Articles were alſo put in againſt the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> with a Confeſſion ſigned by him. But ſome objected, that they ought not to proceed,
<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi> fined, but reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</note> till they knew whether he had ſigned it voluntarily, or not; and ſome were ſent to examine him, he acknowledged he had done it freely, but proteſted that his errours had flowed rather from Indiſcretion than Malice, and denied all treaſonable deſigns againſt the King, or the Realm: he was fined in 2000 <hi>l.</hi> a year in Land, and in the loſs of all his Goods and Offices. He complained of the heavineſs of this Cenſure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired earneſtly to be reſtored to the Kings favour, and promiſed to carry himſelf ſo humbly and obediently, that he ſhould make amends for his paſt follies, which was thought a ſign of too abject a mind; others excuſed it, ſince the power and malice of his Enemies was ſuch, that he was not ſafe as long as he continued in Priſon: he was diſcharged in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>February:</hi> ſoon after he had his pardon, and did ſo manage his intereſt in the King, that he was again brought both to the Court and Council in <hi>April.</hi> But if theſe ſubmiſſions gained him ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at Court, they ſunk him as much in the eſteem of the World.</p>
               <p>The Reformation was now,
<note place="margin">A Progreſs in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> after this confuſion was over, carried on again with vigour. The Council ſent Orders over <hi>England,</hi> to require all to conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the new ſervice, and to call in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170737:235"/>all the Books of the old Offices. An Act paſt in Parliament to the ſame effect; one Earl, ſix Biſhops, and four Lords only diſſenting: all the old Books and Images were appointed to be defaced, and all prayers to Saints were to be ſtruck out of the Primers publiſhed by the late King. A Subſidy was granted, and the King gave a General Pardon, out of which all Priſoners on the account of the State, and Anabaptiſts were excepted. In this Seſſion the Eldeſt Sons of Peers were firſt allowed to ſit in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
               <p>The Committee appointed to prepare the Book of Ordination, finiſhed their work with common conſent, only <hi>Heath</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> refuſed to ſign it, for which he was called before the Council, and required to do it, but he ſtill refuſing,
<note place="margin">The Book of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions put out.</note> was ſent to Priſon. This was thought hard meaſure, to puniſh one for not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in a thing not yet ſetled by Law. <hi>Heath</hi> was a Complier, who went along with the changes that were made, but was ready upon the firſt favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, to return back to the old ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. It was found, that in the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church, there was nothing uſed in Ordinations, but Prayer and Impoſition of hands: the Additions of Anointing and giving conſecrated Veſtments were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brought in. And in the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> it was declared that the Rite of Ordaining a Prieſt, was the delivering
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170737:236"/>the Veſſels for the Euchariſt, with a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to offer Sacrifices to God for the Dead and Living, which was a Novelty invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſupport the belief of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. So all theſe additions were cut off, and Ordination was reſtored to a greater ſimplicity, and the form was made almoſt the ſame that we ſtill uſe, only then in ordaining a Prieſt, the Biſhop was to lay one hand on his Head, and with the other to give him a Bible, and a Chalice, and Bread in it. In the Conſecration of a Biſhop, the form was the ſame, that we ſtill retain, only then they kept up the cuſtom of giving the Biſhop a ſtaff, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe words, <hi>Be to the Flock of Chriſt a Shepherd.</hi> In the middle of the ſixth Century, the Anointing the Prieſts hands was begun in <hi>France,</hi> but was not uſed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, for two Ages after that. In the eighth Century, the Veſtments were given with a ſpecial bleſſing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering Prieſts to offer Expiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; then their Heads were Anointed: and in the tenth Century, the belief of Tranſubſtantiation being received, the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels for the Sacrament were delivered. It is evident from the ſeveral forms of Ordination, that the Church did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it ſelf tied to one manner, and that the Prayer, which in ſome Ages was the Prayer of Conſecration, was in other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges eſteemed only a Prayer preparatory to it. There were ſome ſponſions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, as a Covenant, to which the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170737:236"/>was a Seal: The firſt of theſe was, that the Perſons that came to receive Orders, profeſſed that they believed they were inwardly moved to it by the Holy Ghoſt. If this were well conſidered, it would no doubt put many that thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sacred Offices to a ſtand, who, if they examine themſelves well, dare not pretend to that, concerning which, perhaps they know nothing, but that they have it not: and if they make the anſwer preſcribed in the Book, without feeling any ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their heart, they do publickly lye to God, and againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and have no reaſon to expect a bleſſing on Orders ſo obtained. But too many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that only as a Ceremony in Law, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make them capable of ſome Place of Profit, and not as the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Lives and labours to God, and to the gaining of Souls. It were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for the Church, if Biſhops would not think it enough barely to put theſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, but would uſe great ſtrictneſs in examining before hand the motives that ſet on thoſe, who come to be Ordained. Another ſponſion is, that the Prieſts ſhall teach the People, committed to their charge, and exhort them both in private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and viſit the ſick. By this they plight their faith to God, for the care of Souls, to be managed by them in perſon, and upon that they muſt find the Paſtoral care to be a load indeed: and ſo will neither deſert their Flocks, nor hire them out to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170737:237"/>weak, and perhaps ſcandalous Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. In which the faultineſs of ſome have brought a blemiſh on this Church, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſcandal to many, who could not have been ſo eaſily perſwaded to divide from it, if it had not been, that they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced by ſuch groſs and publick abuſes.</p>
               <p>The Council was now much perplexed with the buſineſs of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> and though they had oppoſed the delivering it up by the Protector, yet that end being ſerved in pulling him down, they were convinced of the neceſſity of doing it, and ſo were indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to liſten to the propoſition that one <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotti</hi> made for a Treaty. He was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Conſtable <hi>Monmorancy,</hi> and gave them aſſurances that as ſoon as that was ended, the <hi>French</hi> King would engage on the behalf of the oppreſt Princes of the Empire.</p>
               <p>At this time Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third died.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pool</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Pope, but loſt it.</note> In the Conclave that followed, Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> ſet up Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> whoſe wiſe behaviour at <hi>Trent</hi> had raiſed his eſteem much; it alſo appeared that though he was of the Emperours faction, yet he did not ſerve him blindly. Some loaded him both with the imputations of <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> and of Incontinence: The laſt would not have hindred his advancement much, though true, yet he fully cleared himſelf of it: But the former lay heavier, for in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement at <hi>Viterbo,</hi> where he was Legate, he had given himſelf much to the ſtudy of Controverſies; and <hi>Tranellius, Flaminio,</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:170737:237"/>and others ſuſpected of <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> had lived in his houſe; and in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> he ſeemed favourable to ſome of their opinions; but the great ſufferings both of himſelf and Family in <hi>England,</hi> ſeemed to ſet him above all ſuſpicions. When the party for him, had almoſt gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſufficient number of Suffrages, he ſeemed little concerned at it, and did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decline, than aſpire to that dignity: And expreſſed a pitch of Philoſophy on this occaſion, that was more ſuitable to Ancient than Modern patterns. When a full number had agreed, and came to adore him, according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ceremony, he received it with his uſual coldneſs; and that being done in the night, he ſaid, <hi>God loved light,</hi> and therefore adviſed them to delay it till day came. The <hi>Italians,</hi> among whom Ambition paſſes for the Character of a great mind, looked on this as an unſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able piece of dulneſs; ſo the Cardinals ſhrunk from him before day, and choſe <hi>de Monte</hi> Pope, who reigned by the name of <hi>Julius</hi> the Third. His firſt promotion was very extraordinary, for he gave his own Hat to a Servant that kept his Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key; and being askt the reaſon of it, he ſaid, He ſaw as much in his Servant to recommend him to be a Cardinal, as the Conclave ſaw in him to induce them to chuſe him Pope. But others imputed this to an unnatural affection for him.</p>

               <p>Embaſſadours were ſent over to <hi>France,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruſſel, Paget</hi> made alſo a Lord, and ſome others, to ſettle the Treaty of Peace: They were ordered in the firſt place to ask the delivery of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queen,

In Concluſion, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> after a Proteſtation, by which they reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the King all the rights that he had at the beginning of the War, agreed to deliver up <hi>Bulloign,</hi> and all the places about it, and all the Ordnance in it, except what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had caſt, for which the <hi>French</hi> were to pay them four hundred thouſand Crowns: All the places which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had in <hi>Scotland</hi> were to be delivered up, and the Forts razed; and ſix Hoſtages were to be given on both ſides for the performance, who were the Sons of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170737:238"/>the men of the greateſt quality. So was the Peace fully concluded, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were duly performed on both hands: The Council approved of the proceedings of their Plenipotentiaries, only the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who had declared himſelf much againſt the delivery of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſickneſs, and was abſent.</p>

His Patent was not during pleaſure, but during life. It does not appear that there was any deſign in this Reign to put down Cathedrals; for though <hi>Weſtminſter, Glouceſter,</hi> and <hi>Durham</hi> were ſuppreſſed, the two former being united, one to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and another to <hi>Worceſter;</hi> and the latter being to be divided in two, yet in

               <p>
                  <hi>Gardiner</hi> continued ſtill in priſon: Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Protectors Miniſtry ſome Privy Counſellors dealt with him,

Upon the Protectors fall, he expected he ſhould have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of his Impriſonment, and thought it ſo near, that he made a farewel Feaſt to the Officers in the <hi>Tower.</hi> Some Privy Counſellours were ſent to him with Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, acknowledging former offences, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Book of Common Prayer, and aſſerting the Kings Power when he was under age, and his authority to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form abuſes in the Church, and that the ſix Articles were juſtly abrogated. He ſigned the Paper, only he wrote on the Margin, that he could not confeſs former offences, for he was not convinced of any fault he had done. Upon this, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that he was to be quickly let out; but another Meſſage was ſent him, that he muſt confeſs that he had been juſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: This he plainly refuſed to do, and ſaid he would never defame himſelf. <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> was ſent to him with a new Paper, in which the confeſſion of his faults was
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170737:239"/>more ſoftly worded; the reſt related to the Popes power, the ſuppreſſing the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies and Chantries, Pilgrimages, Maſſes, Images, the Adoration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Communion in both kinds, the aboliſhing the old Books of Service, and ſetting up the new; with the Book of Ordinations, and the lawfulneſs of a married Clergy: But he ſaid he would ſign no more Articles while he continued in Priſon; and deſired that he might be either tried, or ſet at liberty; for he asked not Mercy, but Juſtice. And being called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council, and required to ſign thoſe Articles, he gave them the ſame anſwer: He ſaid ſome of theſe points were already ſetled by Law, others were not ſo, and in theſe he was at liberty to do as he pleaſed. Upon this, his Biſhoprick was ſequeſtred, and he was required to conform himſelf within three months, under pain of depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the freedome of the <hi>Tower</hi> was denied him. All this was much cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, as contrary to Law, and the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, and it was ſaid that it ſavoured more of a Court of Inquiſition, than of a legal way of proceeding. The Canon Law was not yet rectified, ſo the King being in the Popes room, this way, <hi>ex Officio</hi> was excuſed, as grounded upon the forms of the Spiritual Courts.</p>
               <p>There was a diſcourſe on foot, of a Marriage between the King, and a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>France,</hi> which grieved the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, who rather wiſht him to marry <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximilians</hi>

He preached this as his laſt Sermon, and ſo uſed great freedome: He complained that the Kings debts were not paid, and yet his Officers grew vaſtly rich: He pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King not to ſeek his pleaſures too much, and charged all about him to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him.</p>
               <p>The See of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> fell vacant,

He had ſome ſcruples about the Epiſcopal Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and thought that all thoſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, having been Conſecrated with much ſuperſtition, were to be reckoned among the Elements condemned by S. <hi>Paul:</hi> But <hi>Ridley</hi> juſtified the uſe of them, and ſaid the Elements condemned by S. <hi>Paul</hi> were only the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies; which, though the Apoſtles condemned, when they were
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170737:240"/>impoſed as neceſſary, for that imported, that the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law was not yet abrogated, and that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was not come; Yet they themſelves uſed them at other times, to gain upon the <hi>Jews</hi> by that Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And if Apoſtles did ſuch things to gain them, Subjects ought much more to obey the Laws in matters indifferent: And Superſtitious Conſecrations was as good an Argument for throwing down all the Churches, as for laying aſide thoſe Habits. <hi>Cranmer</hi> deſired <hi>Bucer</hi>'s opinion concerning the lawfulneſs of thoſe Habits, and the obligation lying on Subjects to obey the Laws about them. His opinion was, that every creature of God was good, and that no former abuſe could make a thing indifferent in its ſelf, become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: He thought ancient cuſtomes ought not to be lightly changed, and that there might be a good uſe made of thoſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that they might well expreſs the purity and candour that became all who miniſtred in Holy things, and that it was a ſin to diſobey the Laws in ſuch matters. Yet ſince thoſe Garments had been abuſed to Superſtition, and were like to become a ſubject of Contention, he wiſhed they might be taken away by Law; and that Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, and a more compleat Reformation might be ſet up, and that a ſtop might be put to the robbing of Churches; otherwiſe, they might ſee in the preſent State of <hi>Germany,</hi> a dreadful proſpect of that which <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:170737:241"/>ought to look for. He alſo writ to the ſame effect to <hi>Hooper,</hi> and wiſhed that all good men would unite againſt the greater Corruptions, and then leſſer abuſes would eaſily be redreſſed. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> did alſo deliver his opinion to the ſame purpoſe, and was much troubled at <hi>Hooper</hi>'s ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and at ſuch conteſts among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of true Religion. <hi>Hooper</hi> was ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Preaching; but the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> writ to <hi>Cranmer</hi> to diſpenſe with him in that matter: He anſwered, That while the Law continued in force, he could not do it without incurring a <hi>Praemunire.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, the King writ to him, allowing him to do it, and diſpenſing with the Law: Yet this matter was not ſetled till a year after. <hi>John à Laſco,</hi> with ſome <hi>Germans</hi> of the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Confeſſion, came this year into <hi>England,</hi> being driven out of <hi>Germany</hi> by the Perſecution there: They were erected by Letters Patents into a Corporation, and <hi>à Laſco</hi> was their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent; he being a ſtranger, medled too much in <hi>Engliſh</hi> affairs, and wrote both againſt the Habits, and againſt kneeling in the Sacrament. <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> was this year ſuffered to go out of <hi>England,</hi> and ſtill to hold the preferments he had in it. <hi>Pomet</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and <hi>Caverdale</hi> Co-adjutor to <hi>Veyſy</hi> in <hi>Exeter.</hi>

<note place="margin">A review of the Common-Prayer-Book.</note> for a review of the Common-Prayer-Book: In order to which <hi>Bucer</hi>'s opinion was ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He approved the main parts of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170737:241"/>former Book, he wiſhed there might be not only a denunciation againſt ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perſons that came to the Sacrament, but a diſcipline to exclude them: That the Habits might be laid aſide, that no part of the Communion Office might be uſed, except when there was a Sacrament; that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions might be more frequent, that the Prayers might be ſaid in a plain voice, that the Sacrament might be put in the peoples hands, and that there might be no Prayers for the Dead, which had not been uſed in <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s time: He adviſed a change of ſome phraſes in the Office of the Communion, that favoured Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation too much, and that Baptiſm might be only in Churches: He thought the hallowing the Water, the Chriſme, and the White garment, were too ſceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; nor did he approve of adjuring the Devil, nor of the Godfathers anſwering in the Childs name: He thought Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſhould be delayed till the perſon was of Age, and came ſincerely to renew the Baptiſmal Covenant. He adviſed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing every Holy-day, both of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and the Adult, he diſliked private Marriages, Extream Unction, and offering Chriſomes at the Churching of Women: And thought there ought to be greater ſtrictneſs uſed in the examining of thoſe who came to receive Orders.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time he underſtood that the King expected a New-years gift from him, of a Book written particularly for his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170737:242"/>own uſe: So he made a Book for him, concerning the Kingdom of Chriſt: He preſt much the ſetting up a ſtrict diſcipline, the Sanctification of the Lords day,

               <p>The young King was much pleaſed with theſe advices;
<note place="margin">The Kings great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> and upon that, began him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to form a Scheme for amending many
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170737:242"/>things that were amiſs in the Government, which he writ with his own hand, and in a ſtile and manner that had much of a Child in it, though the thoughts were man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: It appears by it, that he intended to ſet up a Church diſcipline, and ſettle a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for breeding of youth; but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is not finiſhed. He alſo writ a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of every thing that paſt at home, and of the news that came from beyond Sea. It has clear marks of his own Compoſing, as well as it is written with his own hand. He wrote another diſcourſe in <hi>French,</hi> being a Collection of all the places of Scripture againſt Idolatry, with a Preface before it, dedicated to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector.</p>
               <p>At this time <hi>Ridley</hi> made his firſt Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Dioceſs;
<note place="margin">Altars put down.</note> the Articles upon which he proceeded, were chiefly relating to the Service and Ceremonies that were aboliſhed, whether any continued to uſe them or not, and whether there were any Anabaptiſts, or others, that uſed private Conventicles. He alſo carried ſome Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with him, againſt ſome remainders of the former ſuperſtition, and for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the people to give Alms, and to come oft to the Sacrament, and that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars might be removed, and Tables put in their room, in the moſt convenient place of the Chancel. In the Ancient Church their Tables were of Wood: But the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament being called a Sacrifice, as Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Alms, and all Holy Oblations were,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170737:243"/>they came to be called <hi>Altars.</hi> This gave the riſe to the Opinion of Expiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Maſs, and therefore it was thought fit to take away both the name and form of Altars. <hi>Ridley</hi> only adviſed the Curates to do this, but upon ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts ariſing concerning it, the Council in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed, and required it to be done; and ſent with their Order, a Paper of Reaſons juſtifying it: Shewing that a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was more proper than an Altar; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſince the opinion of an Expiatory Sacrifice was ſupported by it. Sermons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be preached in ſome Churches on working-days, this occaſioned great run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about, and idleneſs; and raiſed emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation among the Clergy: upon which the Council ordered them all to be put down. Since that time there has been great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention concerning theſe; they were facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly kept up by ſome, and too violently ſuppreſſed by others: But now that matter is quieted, and they are in many places ſtill continued, to the great edification of the people. The Government was now free of all diſturbance: the Coyn was reformed, and Trade was encouraged. The faction in the Court ſeemed alſo to be extinguiſht, by a Marriage between the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>'s Son, and the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi>'s Daughter. The Duke of <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> made a Propoſition of Marriage with Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> but the Treaty with the Infant of <hi>Portugal</hi> did ſtill depend,

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170737:243"/>of <hi>Chaſtelherault</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> was wholly led by his baſe Brothers Counſels, who, though he was Arch-biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> yet gave himſelf up, without any diſguiſe, to his pleaſures, and kept another mans Wife avowedly; by ſuch means were the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more eaſily diſpoſed to hearken to the new Teachers, and prepared for the changes that followed. The Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went to <hi>France,</hi> on deſign to procure the Government of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be put in her hands.</p>
               <p>A Diet was called in <hi>Germany;</hi>

It was now viſible that the deſign of the late War was to extinguiſh the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to ſet up Tyranny. It was better to obey God than Man: And they were reſolved to put all to hazard, rather than give up their Religion.

The Emperour reckoned that he might well truſt him as long as he had <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxe,</hi> in his hands: But he had provoked him too much in the matter of the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> his Father-in-Law, to repoſe ſuch conſequence in him; ſo that this proved a fatal errour to him, by which he loſt the power he had then in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi> proved too hard for him in diſſimulation, in which he was ſo great a Maſter.</p>

                     <hi>Bucer</hi>'s death.</note> and griping of the Guts. He had great apprehenſions of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170737:245"/>a fatal revolution in <hi>England;</hi> by reaſon of the ill lives of the People, occaſioned chiefly by the want of Eccleſiaſtical Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and the neglect of the Paſtoral charge. Orders were ſent from the <hi>Court,</hi> to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to bury him with all the Publick honour to his Memory, that could be deviſed. Speeches and Sermons were made both by <hi>Haddon,</hi> the Univerſity Orator, and <hi>Parker,</hi> and <hi>Redmayn.</hi> The laſt of theſe was one of the moſt extraordinary Men, both for Learning, and a true Judgment of things, that was in that time: he had alſo in many things differed from <hi>Bucer,</hi> and yet he acknowledged, that there was none alive, of whom he hoped now to learn ſo much, as he had done by his converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him. <hi>Bucer</hi> was inferior to none of all the Reformers in Learning, but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to moſt of them, in an excellent temper of mind, and a great zeal for preſerving the Unity of the Church: a rare quality in that Age, in which <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> and he were the moſt eminent. He had not that nimbleneſs of diſputing, for which <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> was more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the Popiſh Doctors took advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from that to carry themſelves more inſolently towards him.</p>
               <p>Soon after this,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                  <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s Proceſs was put to an end: A Commiſſion was iſſued out to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and three Biſhops, and ſome Civilians, to proceed againſt him, for his contempt, in refuſing to ſign the Articles offered to him: he complained,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170737:245"/>that all that was done againſt him, was out of malice, that he had been long impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, and nothing was objected to him, that he was reſolved to obey the Laws and Orders of Council, but that he would acknowledge no fault, not having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any. The things objected to him, were, that he refuſed to ſet out in his Sermon the King's power, when he was under Age, and had affronted the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, whom the King had ſent to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſs; that he had been negligent in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting the King's Injunctions, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to confeſs his fault, or ask the King pardon; and it was ſaid that the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons raiſed in <hi>England,</hi> might have been prevented, if he had timouſly ſet forth the King's authority: he anſwered, that he was not required to do it by any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Council, but only in a private diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; yet Witneſſes being examined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe particulars, the Delegates pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to ſentence of deprivation againſt him, notwithſtanding his Appeal to the King in Perſon: and he was appointed to lie ſtill in the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he continued till Queen <hi>Mary</hi> diſcharged him. Nothing was pretended to excuſe the ſeverity of theſe proceedings, but that he having taken out a Commiſſion for holding his Biſhoprick, only during the King's pleaſure, he could not complain when that was intimated to him: and if he had been turned out meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon pleaſure, without the Pomp of a Proceſs, the matter might have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170737:246"/>excuſed. <hi>Poinet</hi> was put in his See, and had 2000. Marks in Lands aſſigned him for his ſubſiſtence. <hi>Story</hi> was put in <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and upon <hi>Veyſy</hi>'s reſignation <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verdale</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Exeter.</hi> The ſcruples that <hi>Hooper</hi> made, were now ſo far ſatisfied, that he was content both to be conſecrated in his Veſtments, and to uſe them when he preached before the King, or in his Cathedral, but he was diſpenſed with upon other occaſions.</p>
               <p>By this time the greater number of the Biſhops were Men that heartily received the Reformation:
<note place="margin">The Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Religion agreed on.</note> ſo it was reſolved now to proceed to a ſettlement of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church: many thought that ſhould have been done in the firſt place. But <hi>Cranmer</hi> judged it was better to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſlowly in that matter: he thought the Corruptions in the Worſhip were to be begun with, ſince while they remained, the addreſſes to God were ſo defiled, that thereby all People were involved in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful compliances: he thought ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Opinions might come laſt, ſince er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in them were not of ſuch ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: and he judged it neceſſary to lay theſe open, in many Treatiſes and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, before they ſhould proceed to make alterations, that ſo all People might be before-hand ſatisfied with what ſhould be done. So now they framed a Body of Articles, which contained the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> they were caſt into forty two Articles, and afterwards
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170737:246"/>ſome few alterations being made in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, they were reduced to XXXIX. which being in all Peoples hands, need not be much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged on.</p>
               <p>In the Ancient Church, there was at firſt a great ſimplicity in their Creeds; but afterwards, upon the breaking out of Hereſies, concerning the Perſon of Chriſt, equivocal ſenſes being put on the terms formerly uſed, new ones, that could not be ſo eaſily eluded, were invented. A humour of explaining Myſteries by ſimilies and niceties, and of paſſing Anathema's on all that did not receive theſe, did much over-run the Church: and though the Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> decreed, that no new additions ſhould be made to the Creed, yet that did not reſtrain thoſe, who loved to make all their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits be received, as parts of the Faith. The Fathers were carried too far with this curioſity, but the Schoolmen went farther, and ſpun the Thread much finer, they condemned every thing that differed from their Notions, as Heretical: Many of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> had retained much of that peremptorineſs, and were not eaſie to thoſe who differed from them. In <hi>England</hi> great care was taken to frame theſe Articles in the moſt comprehenſive words, and the greateſt ſimplicity poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
<note place="margin">Changes made in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-book.</note>
               </p>
               <p>When this was ſetled, they went about the review of the Common-prayer-Book.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170737:247"/>In the daily ſervice, they added the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Abſolution, that ſo the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God might begin with a grave and humble Confeſſion conceived in general words, but to which every one ought to joyn a ſecret confeſſion of his particular ſins: after which a ſolemn declaration of the mercy of God, according to the terms of the Goſpel, was to be pronounced by the Prieſt. This was thought much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than the giving Abſolution in ſuch formal words, as, <hi>I abſolve thee,</hi> which begat in the undiſcerning Vulgar an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Prieſt had authority to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſin, and that made them think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much, as how to purchaſe it at his hands: and it proved, as it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, the greateſt Engine that ever was, for overthrowing the power of Religion. In the Communion-Service, they ordered a recital of the Commandments, with a ſhort devotion between every one of them, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that till Church-Diſcipline were reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nothing could more effectually awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſuch, as came to receive it, to a due ſeriouſneſs in it, than the hearing the Law of God thus pronounced, with thoſe ſtops in it, to make the People reflect on their offences againſt it. The Chriſm, the uſe of the Croſs in conſecrating the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, Prayers for the Dead, and ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that favoured Tranſubſtantiation were laid aſide, and the Book was put in the ſame Order and Method, in which it continues to this day, excepting only ſome
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170737:247"/>inconſiderable variations, that have been made ſince. A Rubrick was added to the Office of the Communion, explaining the reaſon of kneeling in it, that it was only as an expreſſion of due reverence and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, upon the receiving ſo particular a mark of the favour of God: but that no adoration was intended by it, and that they did not think Chriſt was corporally preſent in it. In Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time this was left out, that ſuch as conformed in other things, but ſtill retained the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Corporal Preſence, might not be offended at ſuch a Declaration: It was again put in the Book, upon his preſent Majeſties Reſtoration, for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Scruples of thoſe who excepted to that poſture. Chriſt did at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute this Sacrament, in the ordinary Table-geſture. <hi>Moſes</hi> appointed the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb to be eaten by the People ſtanding, with ſtaves in their hands, they being then to begin their march; yet that was afterwards changed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> who did eat it in the poſture common at Meals, which our Saviour's practice juſtifies: ſo, though Chriſt in his ſtate of Humiliation did Inſtitute this Ordinance, in ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar a poſture, yet it was thought more becoming the reverence due to him in his Exaltation, to celebrate it with greater expreſſions of humility and devotion. The Ancient Chriſtians received it ſtanding, and bowing their Body downward: Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was afterwards uſed as a higher ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170737:248"/>of devout worſhip: but great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is to be made, between the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which, upon lifting up the Hoſt, all fall down and worſhip, and our being, during the whole action, in one continued po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of devotion: and if the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were more bound up to Ceremonies, made a change in the poſture, at the Memorial of their deliverance, without any warrant mentioned in the Old Teſtament; it muſt be acknowledged, that the Chriſtian Church, which is more at liberty in ſuch matters, had authority to make the like change of the poſture, in this Memorial of Chriſt's ſufferings. At this time ſix of the moſt eminent Preachers were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to wait on the <hi>Court</hi> by turns, two at a time, and the other four were ſent as Itinerant Preachers, into all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>England,</hi> in a Circuit, for ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the defects of the Clergy, who were generally very weak and faulty.</p>
               <p>The Maſs ſaid in Lady <hi>Mary</hi>'s Chappel,
<note place="margin">Lady <hi>Mary</hi> in trouble for having Maſs ſaid.</note> was now again challenged. The Court was leſs afraid of the Emperours diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure than formerly, and ſo would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger bear with ſo publick a breach of Law: And the Promiſe they had made being but Temporary, and never given in Writing, they thought they were not bound by it. But the Emperour aſſured her, that he had an abſolute Promiſe for that Priviledge to her: This encouraged her ſo much, that when the Council wrote to her, ſhe ſaid ſhe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170737:248"/>would follow the Catholick Church, and adhere to her Fathers Religion. Anſwer was writ in the Kings name, requiring her to obey the Law, and not to pretend that the King was under age, ſince the late Rebels had juſtified themſelves by that. The way of Worſhip then eſtabliſhed, was alſo vindicated, as moſt conſonant to the word of God. But ſhe refuſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage into any diſputes, only ſhe ſaid ſhe would continue in her former courſes. And ſhe was thinking of going out of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> inſomuch that the Emperour or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Ship to lie near the Coaſt for her Tranſportation; which was ſtrange advice, for it is probable, if ſhe had gone beyond Sea, ſhe had been effectually ſhut out from ſucceeding to the Crown. The Emperour eſpouſed her quarrel ſo warmly, that he threatned to make War, if ſhe ſhould be hardly uſed, and the Merchants having then great effects at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> it was not thought fit to give him a colour for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, and ſeizing on theſe; ſo the Council were willing to let the matter fall, and only adviſed her to have her Maſs privately ſaid: yet the young King could not be eaſily induced to yield to that, for he ſaid, he ought not to connive at Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Council ordered <hi>Cranmer, Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and <hi>Poinet,</hi> to ſatisfie him in it: And they convinced him, that though he ought not to conſent to any ſin, yet he was not at all times obliged to puniſh it. He burſt out in weeping, lamenting his Siſters ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170737:249"/>and his own circumſtances, that obliged him to comply with ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious way of Worſhip. Dr. <hi>Wotton</hi> was ſent over to the Emperour, to convince him that no abſolute Promiſe was ever made: For <hi>Paget</hi> and <hi>Hobbey,</hi> whom the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour vouched for it, declared upon Oath, that they made not any but what was Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary; and ſince the King did not meddle in the concerns of the Emperours Family, it was not reaſonable for him to interpoſe in this. The Emperor pretended, that he had promiſed to her Mother at her death, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect her, and ſo he was bound in honour to take care of her: But now when the Council were not in ſuch fear of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours diſpleaſure as formerly, they ſent to ſeize on two of her Chaplains, that had ſaid Maſs in her Houſe, when ſhe was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; they kept out of the way, and ſhe writ to the Council to ſtop the proſecution, and continued to ſtand upon the Promiſe made to the Emperour. A long anſwer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to her by the Council, in which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the matter of the Promiſe was cleared, they urged her with the abſurdity of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in an unknown tongue, offering the Sacrament for the dead, and worſhipping Images: All the Ancients appealed upon all occaſions to the Scriptures, by theſe ſhe might eaſily diſcover the errours and cheats of the old Superſtition, that were ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by falſe Miracles and lying Stories. They concluded, that they being truſted with the execution of the Laws, were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170737:249"/>to proceed equally. <hi>Mallet,</hi> one of the Chaplains, was taken, and ſhe earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired that he might be ſet at liberty, but it was denied her. The Council ſent for the chief Officers of her Houſe, and required them to let her know the Kings pleaſure, that ſhe muſt have the new Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in her Family, and to give the like charge to her Chaplains and Servants. This vexed her much, and did almoſt caſt her into ſickneſs: She ſaid, ſhe would obey the King in every thing in which her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was not touched: But charged them not to deliver the Councils Meſſage to her Servants. Upon that, the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, <hi>Petre</hi> and <hi>Wyngfield,</hi> were ſent with the ſame orders to her, and carried to her a Letter from the King, which ſhe received on her knees; but when ſhe read it, ſhe caſt the blame of it on <hi>Cecyl,</hi> then Secretary of State. The Chancellour told her, the whole Council were of one mind, that they could not ſuffer her to uſe a form of Worſhip againſt Law: And had ordered them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate this both to herſelf and her Family. She made great proteſtations of duty to the King; but ſaid, ſhe would die rather than uſe any form of Worſhip but that which was left by her Father, only ſhe was afraid ſhe was not worthy to ſuffer on ſo good an account. When the King was of age, ſhe would obey his Commands in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and though he now knew many things above his age, yet as they did not think him yet capable of matters of War or
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170737:250"/>Policy, ſo much leſs could he judge in points of Divinity. If her Chaplains refuſed to ſay Maſs, ſhe could have none, but for the new Service ſhe was reſolved againſt it, and if it were forced on her, ſhe would leave her houſe. She deſired her Officers might be ſent back to her, whom they had put in the <hi>Tower,</hi> for not intimating the Councils order to her Servants; which had been ſtrange for them to have done, when ſhe forbid it. She charged them to uſe her well for her Fathers ſake, who had raiſed them all out of nothing. She was ſick by reaſon of their ill uſage, and if ſhe died, ſhe would lay it at their door. She inſiſted on the Promiſe made to the Emperour, who writ of it to her, and ſhe believed him more than them all: She gave them a token, to be carried to the King, and ſo diſmiſt them. When they had laid a charge on her Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains and Servants, to the ſame effect, and were going away, ſhe called after them, and deſired they would ſend her Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to her, for ſhe was weary of receiving her accounts, and examining how many Loaves were made of a Buſhel of Meal. Upon this reſolution that ſhe expreſt, the Council went no further, only after this, her Maſs was ſaid ſo ſecretly, that ſhe gave no publick ſcandal. From <hi>Copthall,</hi> where this was done, ſhe removed, and lived at <hi>Hunſden,</hi> and thither <hi>Ridley</hi> went to ſee her: She received him very civilly, and ordered her Officers to entertain him at dinner: But when he begged leave to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170737:250"/>Preach before her, ſhe at firſt bluſht, but being further preſt, ſhe ſaid he might Preach in the Pariſh Church, but neither ſhe nor her Family would be there: He asked her if ſhe refuſed to hear the word of God: She anſwered, they did not call that Gods word now, that they had called ſo in her Fathers days; and that in his time they durſt not have ſaid the things which they then Preached: And after ſome ſharp and reproachful diſcourſe, ſhe diſmiſt him. <hi>Wharton,</hi> one of her Officers, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him out, made him drink a little, but he reflecting on that, blamed himſelf for it; for he ſaid, when the Word of God was rejected, he ought to have ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the duſt of his Feet, and gone away. The Kings Siſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did in all things conform to the Laws; for her Mother at her death recommended her to Dr. <hi>Parker</hi>'s care, who inſtructed her well in the Principles of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> began now to form great deſigns of bringing the Crown into his Family:
<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</note> The King was alienated from his Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Privy Council had imbroiled themſelves with her, and ſo would be eaſily engaged againſt her. The pretence againſt both the Siſters was the ſame, that they ſtood illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by two Sentences in the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Courts, confirmed in Parliament. So that it would be a diſgrace to the Nation to let the Crown devolve on Baſtards: And ſince the fears of the Eldeſts revenge,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170737:251"/>made the Council willing to exclude her, the only reaſon on which they could ground that, muſt take place againſt the ſecond likewiſe. And therefore though the Crown was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to them, both by Act of Parliament, and the late Kings Will, yet theſe being founded on an Errour that was indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which was the baſeneſs of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, they ought not to take place. They being laid aſide, the Daughters of the <hi>French</hi> Queen, by <hi>Charles Brandon,</hi> ſtood next in the Act, and yet it was generally believed that they were Baſtards: For it was given out that <hi>Brandon</hi> was ſecretly married to one <hi>Mortimer,</hi> at the time that he married the <hi>French</hi> Queen, and that <hi>Mortimer</hi> out-lived her, ſo that the iſſue by her was Illegitimate. The Sweating Sickneſs did this year break out in <hi>England,</hi> with ſuch Contagion that eight hundred died in one week of it in <hi>London;</hi> thoſe that were taken with it, were inclined much to ſleep, and all that ſlept died, but if they were kept awake a day, they did ſweat it out. <hi>Charles Brandon</hi>'s two Sons by his laſt Wife died within a day one of another. His eldeſt Daughter by the <hi>French</hi> Queen was married to the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> a good, but weak man, and ſo he was made Duke of <hi>Suffolk:</hi> They had no Sons, their eldeſt Daughter <hi>Jane Gray,</hi> was thought the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the age. So the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected a Match between her and his fourth Son <hi>Guilford,</hi> his three elder Sons being then married: And becauſe the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:170737:251"/>was like to ſtand moſt in the way, care was taken to ſend her out of <hi>England:</hi> and a Match was treated for her with the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſplendid Meſſage was ſent to <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> Treaty for a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to, the King.</note> with the Order of the Garter. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Northampton</hi> carried it, three Earls, the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and five Lords were ſent with him, and above two hundred Gentlemen accompanied them. They were to make a Propoſition of Marriage for the King with a Daughter of <hi>France.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> made the firſt Speech, and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> anſwered him: it was ſoon agreed on, yet neither Party was to be bound, either in Honour or Conſcience, till the Lady ſhould be of Years to give conſent. A noble Embaſſy was ſent in return from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with the Order of Saint <hi>Michael.</hi> They deſired in their Maſter's name the continuance of the King's friendſhip, and that he would not be moved by Rumors, that might be raiſed to break their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance. The young King anſwered on the ſudden, <q rend="inline">that Rumours were not always to be believed, nor always to be rejected, for it was no leſs vain to fear all things, than to doubt of nothing: if any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences hapned to ariſe, he ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to determine them, rather by reaſon than by force, ſo far as his Honour ſhould not be thereby diminiſhed.</q> This was thought a very extraordinary
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170737:252"/>anſwer, to be made by one of Fourteen, on the ſudden.</p>
               <p>There was at this time a great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peers.
<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi>'s fall.</note> 
                  <hi>Warwick</hi> was made Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the blood of the <hi>Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> being then under an Attainder: <hi>Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> was made Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſter, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was made Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and a little before this, <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had been made Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and <hi>Darcy</hi> was made a Lord. There was none ſo likely to take the King out of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> hands, as the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> who was beginning to form a new Party about the King; ſo upon ſome Informations, both the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> &amp; his Dutcheſs, Sir <hi>Ralph Vane,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho.

                  <hi>Tho.

Men ready; <hi>Arundel</hi> was to have ſeized on the <hi>Tower,</hi> and all the Gendarmoury were to have been killed. All theſe things were told the young King with ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that he too eaſily believed them,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170737:252"/>and ſo was much alienated from his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, judging him guilty of ſo foul a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy. It was added by others, that the Duke intended to have raiſed the City of <hi>London,</hi> one <hi>Crane</hi> confirmed <hi>Palmers</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, and both the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and <hi>Paget</hi> were alſo committed as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices.

Peers ſat to judge him, among whom were the Dukes of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Pembroke.</hi> The particulars charged on him were, a deſign to ſeize on the King's Perſon, to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and to raiſe the City of <hi>London;</hi> it ſeemed ſtrange to ſee <hi>Northumberland</hi> ſit a Judge, when the crime objected, was a deſign againſt his life: for though by the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> no Peer can be challenged, yet by the Law of Nature no Man can well judge where he is a Party. The Chancellour, though a Peer, was left out, upon ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a reconciliation, which he was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the Duke: He was not well skilled in Law, and neither objected to the Indictment, nor deſired Councel to plead for him, but only anſwered to matters of fact: he denied all deſigns to raiſe the People, or to kill <hi>Northumberland;</hi> if he had talked of it, it was in paſſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Intention: and it was ridiculous to think, that he with a ſmall Troop, could deſtroy the Gendarmoury, who
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170737:253"/>were 900. The armed Men he had about him, were only for his own defence, he had done no miſchief to his Enemies, though it was once in his power to have done it; and he had rendred himſelf without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any reſiſtance: He deſired the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes might be brought face to face, and objected many things to them; chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Palmer;</hi> but that was not done, and their Depoſitions were only read: The King's Councel pleaded upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, againſt unlawful Aſſemblies, that to contrive the death of Privy Counſellors was Felony, and to have Men about him for his defence, was alſo Felony. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial defence was omitted, for by that Statute thoſe Aſſemblies were not feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, except being required to diſperſe themſelves, they had refuſed to do it, and it does not appear that any ſuch Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation had been made in this caſe. The Proofs of his raiſing Rebellion were inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, ſo he was acquitted of Treaſon, which raiſed a great ſhout of joy, that was heard as far as <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> but he was found guilty of Felony, for intending to impriſon <hi>Northumberland.</hi> He carried himſelf, during the Trial, with great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and all the ſharpneſs which the Kings Councel expreſſed in pleading againſt him, did not provoke him to any undecent paſſion. But when Sentence was given, he ſunk a little, and asked the three Lords, that were his Enemies, pardon, for his ill deſigns againſt them, and made ſute for
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170737:253"/>his life, and for his Wife and Children. It was generally thought, that nothing being found againſt him, but an Intention to impriſon a Privy Counſellor, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took effect, one ſo nearly related to the King, would not have been put to death on that account. It was therefore neceſſary to raiſe in the King a great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to him: ſo a ſtory was brought to the King, as if in the <hi>Tower</hi> he had confeſſed a deſign to imploy ſome to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinate thoſe Lords; and the Perſons na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for that wicked ſervice, were alſo perſwaded to take it on them. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing believed by the King, he took no more care to preſerve him, aſſaſſination being a crime of ſo barbarous a nature, that it poſſeſſed him with a horrour, even to his Uncle, when he thought him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it: and therefore he was given up to his Enemies rage. <hi>Stanhop, Partridge, Arundel</hi> and <hi>Vane</hi> were tried next, the two firſt were not much pitied, for they had made a very ill uſe of their Intereſt in the Duke, during his greatneſs: the other two were much lamented. <hi>Arundels</hi> Jury was ſhut up a whole Day and a Night, and thoſe that were for the acquittal, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the fury of the reſt, only that they might ſave their own Lives, and not be ſtarved. <hi>Vane</hi> had done great ſervices in the Wars, and carried himſelf with a Magnanimity, that was thought too extravagant: they were all condemned, and <hi>Partridge</hi> and he were hanged, the other Two were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:170737:254"/>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor was become a ſecret friend to the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and that was thus diſcovered: he went aſide once at Council,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rich</hi> gives up the Great Seal, and it was given to the Biſh. of <hi>Ely.</hi>
                  </note> and writ a Note, giving the Duke notice of what was then in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation againſt him, and endorſed it only for <hi>the Duke,</hi> and ſent it to the <hi>Tower,</hi> but his Servant not having particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, fanſied it was to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and not to <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and carried it to him. He to make <hi>Northumberland</hi> his friend, ſent this to him; <hi>Rich</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miſtake, in which his Servant had fallen, prevented the diſcovery, and went immediately to the King, and pretending ſome indiſpoſition, deſired to be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and upon that took his Bed, ſo it ſeemed too barbarous to do any thing further againſt him, only the Great Seal was taken from him, and was put in the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s hands. This was much cenſured, for all the Reformers had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed ſeverely againſt the ſecular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and high places, which Biſhops had in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince by theſe they were taken wholly off from the care of Souls, or thoſe ſpiritual exerciſes that might diſpoſe them for it, and aſſumed only the name and garb of Churchmen, to ſerve their Ambition and Covetouſneſs; and by this the People were much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt them, ſo upon <hi>Goodrick</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, this was turned againſt the Reformers: it was ſaid, they only complained of thoſe things, when their Enemies enjoyed
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170737:254"/>them, but changed their minds, as ſoon as they fell into the hands of their friends: but <hi>Goodrick</hi> was no Pattern, he complied only with the Reformation, but turned when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſucceeded. Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Who made me a Judge?</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> left it as a Rule, <hi>that no Man that warreth, entangleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the affairs of this life.</hi> This Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the other Fathers underſtood, as a perpetual prohibition of Churchmen's medling with ſecular matters; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it ſeverely. Many Canons were made againſt it in Provincial Councils, and a very full one was decreed at <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon.</hi> But as the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> grew rich, and powerful, they eſtabliſht a ſort of ſecular principality in the Church: and other Sees, as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in wealth, affected to imitate them. <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, raiſed this much every where, and gave great Territories and Priviledges to the Church; upon which, the Biſhop and Abbots, were not only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a ſhare, in the Publick Counſels, by virtue of their Lands, but to all the chief Offices of the State; and then Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Preferments were given to Courtiers, as Rewards for their ſervices: and by theſe means the Clergy became very corrupt, Merit and Learning being no more the ſtandards, by which Men were eſteemed or promoted: and Biſhops were only conſidered, as a ſort of great Men, who went in a peculiar Habit, and on
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170737:255"/>great Feſtivities were obliged to ſay Maſs, or perform ſome other Solemnities, but they wholly abandoned the Souls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their care, and left the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual part of their callings, to their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars and Arch-deacons, who made no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe of it, but to ſqueeze the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Clergy, and to oppreſs the People: and it was not eaſie to perſwade the world, that thoſe Biſhops did much aſpire to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who were ſo indecently thruſting themſelves into the Courts of Princes, and medling ſo much in matters, that did not belong to them, that they neglected thoſe, for which they were to account to God.</p>
               <p>On the 22.
<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi>'s Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> day of <hi>January,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> was executed at <hi>Tower</hi>-Hill, the ſubſtance of his Speech, was a Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of himſelf, <q rend="inline">from all ill deſigns, he confeſſed his private ſins, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the mercies of God, in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him time to Repent: he declared that he had acted ſincerely in all he did, in matters of Religion, while he was in power: and rejoyced for his being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in ſo good a work: he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the People to live ſutably to the doctrine received among them; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they might look for great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from God.</q> As he was going on, there was an unaccountable Noiſe heard, which ſo frighted the People, that many run away. Sir <hi>Anthony Brown</hi> came up, riding towards the Scaffold, which made
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170737:255"/>the Spectators think, that he brought a Pardon, and this occaſioned great ſhouts of Joy, but they ſoon ſaw their miſtakes; ſo the Duke went on in his Speech, <q rend="inline">He declared his chearful ſubmiſſion to the will of God, and deſired them likewiſe to acquieſce in it; he prayed for the King and his Council, and exhorted the People to continue obedient to them: and asked the forgiveneſs of all, whom at any time he had offended.</q> Then he turned to his private devotions, and fitted himſelf for the blow, which upon the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal given, ſevered his Head from his Body.</p>
               <p>He was a Man of extraordinary Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, of great candor, and eminent Piety: he was always a promoter of Juſtice, and a Patron of the oppreſſed. He was a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Captain than a Counſellor, and was too eaſie and open-hearted, to be ſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, as ſuch times, and ſuch Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments required. It was generally believed, all this Conſpiracy, for which he, and the other Four ſuffered, was only a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery: all the other Complices were quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharged, and <hi>Palmer,</hi> the chief Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, became <hi>Northumberlands</hi> particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident: and the indiſcreet words, which the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> had ſpoken, and his gathering armed Men about him, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to <hi>Palmer</hi>'s artifices, who had put him in fear of his life, and ſo made him do, and ſay thoſe things, for which he loſt it. His four friends did all end their
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170737:256"/>Lives, with the moſt ſolemn proteſtations of their Innocence, and the whole matter was lookt on, as a contrivance of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberlands,</hi> by which he loſt the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the People entirely. Some reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Attainder of the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi>'s death, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned likewiſe by a Conſpiracy of their own Servants, in which it was thought, this Duke was too active. He was alſo much cenſured for his Brothers death. He had raiſed much of his Eſtate out of the ſpoils of Biſhops Lands, and his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace out of the Ruines of ſome Churches; and to this ſome added a remark, that he did not claim the benefit of his Clergy, which would have ſaved him, and ſince he had ſo ſpoiled the Church, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted it to a particular Judgment on him, that he forgat it: But in this they were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, for in the Act by which he was condemned, it was provided that no Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ſhould purge that Felony.</p>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Maurice</hi> began this year to form a great deſign: He enter'd into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondences not only with the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> but alſo with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and having given intimations of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns for the liberty of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the ſecurity of the Proteſtant Religion, to ſome that had great credit in <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> he brought that Town to a ſurrender, and having made himſelf ſure of the Army, he quartered his Troops in the Territories
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170737:256"/>of the Popiſh Princes, by which they were all much alarmed, only the Emperour did not apprehend the danger till it was too late for him. A quarrel fell in between the Pope and the King of <hi>France,</hi> about <hi>Parma:</hi> The Pope threatned, if that King would not reſtore <hi>Parma,</hi> he would take <hi>France</hi> from him. Upon that, the Council being now again opened at <hi>Trent,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> proteſted againſt it, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he would call a National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in <hi>France,</hi> and would not obey, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Decrees. The Emperor ſtill preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Germans</hi> to ſend Embaſſadours and Divines to <hi>Trent.</hi> The Council began with the points about the Euchariſt, and it was ordered that theſe ſhould be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled according to the Scriptures and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authors; the <hi>Italians</hi> did not like this, and ſaid the bringing many quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was only an Act of Memory, and that way would give the <hi>Lutherans</hi> great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages: The ſublime ſpeculations of the Schools, together with their terms, were much ſafer Weapons to deal with. A Safe-Conduct was demanded from the Council, for the Emperours Conduct was not thought ſufficient, ſince at <hi>Conſtance, John Hus,</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> were burnt, though they had the Emperours Safe-Conduct. The Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> had granted a very full one to the <hi>Bohemians;</hi> ſo the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> demanded one in the ſame form, but though one was granted, yet it was in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things ſhort of that. The Elector of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170737:257"/>
                  <hi>Brandenburg</hi> ſent an Embaſſadour to <hi>Trent,</hi> who made a general Speech of the reſpect his Maſter had for them. The Legates anſwered, and thanked him for ſubmitting to their Decrees, of which the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour had not ſaid a word; but when he expoſtulated about it, the Legates ſaid, they anſwered him according to that he ought to have ſaid, and not to that he did ſay. The Council decreed, the manner of Chriſts preſence to be ineffable, and yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Tranſubſtantiation was a fit term for it; for that was a notion as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable as any that could be thought on: Then they decreed the neceſſity of Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Confeſſion, that thereby Prieſts might keep a proportion between Penances and Sins, which was thought a mockery; for the trade of ſlight Penances, and eaſie Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions for the greateſt ſins, ſhewed there was no care taken to adjuſt the one to the other. The Embaſſadour of the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> came, and moved for a Safe-Conduct to their Divines to come and maintain their Doctrine: The Legates an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, they would enter into no diſputes with them, but if they came with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mind, and propoſed their ſcruples, they would ſatisfie them. Embaſſadours from ſome Towns arrived at <hi>Trent,</hi> and thoſe ſent by the Duke of <hi>Saxe</hi> were on their way, upon which the Emperour ordered his Agents, to gain time, and hinder the Council to proceed in their deciſions till thoſe were heard, but all he could prevail
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170737:257"/>in, was that the Article concerning the Communion in both kinds, was poſtponed till they ſhould come.</p>
               <p>The day after the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi>'s exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1552"/> a Seſſion of Parliament was aſſembled.
<note place="margin">A Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> The firſt Act they paſt was about the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book, as it was now amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: To it only one Earl, two Biſhops, and two Lords diſſented. The Book was appointed to be every where received after <hi>All-hallows</hi> next. The Biſhops were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to proceed by the cenſures of the Church, againſt ſuch as came not to it; they alſo authorized the Book of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and enacted the ſame Penalties againſt offendors, that were in the Act for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Book three years before. The Papiſts took occaſion on the changes now made in the Book, to ſay, that the new Doctrines and ways of Worſhip changed as faſt as the faſhions did. It was anſwered, That it was no wonder if corruptions, which had been creeping in for a thouſand years, were not all diſcovered, and thrown out at once; and ſince they had been every age making additions of new Ceremonies, it might be excuſed, if the Purging them out was done by ſuch eaſie degrees. The Book was not to be received till <hi>All-hallows,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was hoped that between and then the Reformation of the Eccleſiaſtical Laws would have been finiſhed: A Bill concerning Treaſons paſt with only one diſſent, it was much oppoſed in the H. of Commons; for
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170737:258"/>the multiplying of Treaſons is always lookt on as a ſeverity in the Government. One Bill was rejected, but another was agreed on, <q rend="inline">If any called the King, or his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, named in the Statute of 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Heretick, Tyrant, or other opprobrious words, he was for the firſt offence to be puniſhed with a forfeiture of Goods and Chattels, for the ſecond with a <hi>Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi> and the third offence was made Treaſon: but if it was done in printing or writing, the firſt offence was Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. None were to be proſecuted for words, but within three Months: and two Witneſſes were made neceſſary, who ſhould aver their Depoſitions to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties face.</q> This ſeems to relate to the proceedings againſt the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> in which the Witneſſes did not appear, ſo that he loſt the advantage of croſs examining them: and many times Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and guilt diſcover themſelves, when the Parties are confronted. Another Law paſt for Holy-days and Faſts. <q rend="inline">No days were to be eſteemed <hi>Holy</hi> in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by reaſon of thoſe Holy duties which ought to be done in them, for which they were dedicated to the ſervice of God. Days were eſteemed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated only to the honour of God, even thoſe in which the Saints were comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morated; <hi>Sundays,</hi> and the other Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days were to be religiouſly obſerved, and the Biſhops were to proceed to Cenſures againſt offenders, only Labourers or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher-men
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170737:258"/>in caſe of neceſſity, might work on them: The Eves before them were to be Faſts, and abſtinence from Fleſh was enacted, both in <hi>Lent,</hi> and on <hi>Fridays</hi> and <hi>Saturdays.</hi>
                  </q> This liberty to Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to work on theſe days, was abuſed to a publick profanation of them, but the ſtricter clauſes in the Act were little regarded. An Act paſt, empowering Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens to gather Collections for the poor, and the Biſhops to proceed againſt ſuch as refuſed to contribute; which though it was a Bill that taxed the people, yet had its firſt riſe in the Houſe of Lords. A Bill was paſt by the Lords, but rejected by the Commons, for ſecuring the Clergy from falling under the laſh of a <hi>Praemunire</hi> by Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; and that they ought to be firſt prohibited by the Kings Writ, and not be ſued unleſs they continued after that, ſtiff in their diſobedience. An Act paſt for the Marriage of the Clergy, four Earls and ſix Lords diſſenting from it: <q rend="inline">That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the former Act about it was thought on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a permiſſion of it, as ſome other unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things were connived at; upon which the Wives and Children of the Clergy were reproachfully uſed, and the Word of God was not heard with due reverence; therefore their Marriages were declared good and valid.</q> The Marqueſs of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton</hi> procured an Act, confirming his ſecond Marriage, and that occaſioned ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be propoſed in the Houſe of Lords, that no man might put away his Wife and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170737:259"/>marry another, unleſs he were firſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced; but it was laid aſide by the Commons.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1551"/> The Biſhoprick of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was re-united to <hi>London,</hi> only the Collegiate Church was ſtill continued.</p>
               <p>An Act paſt concerning Uſury,

It was thought at firſt ſuitable to the Brotherly kindneſs that ought to be among Chriſtians, to lend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gain; but at laſt Canons were made
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170737:259"/>againſt taking Uſury, and it was put among the reſerved Caſes. Mortgages were an invention to avoid that,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1552"/> for the uſe was paid as the Rent of the Land mortgaged, and not of the Money lent. Inventions alſo were found for thoſe who had no Land to mortgage, to make ſuch bargains that gain was made of the Money, and yet not in the way of Uſury. Theſe were tricks only to deceive people, and it is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to ſhew how the making ſuch a gain as holds proportion to the value of Land is immoral in it ſelf; if the rule ſetled by Law is not exceeded, and men deal not unmercifully with thoſe, who by inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accidents are diſabled from making payment. Another Bill was paſt againſt Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the reſerving penſions out of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and granting Advowſons while the Incumbent was yet alive, but it had not the Royal Aſſent. Simony has been oft complained of, and many Laws and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons have been made againſt it, but new contrivances are ſtill found out to elude them all: And it is a diſeaſe that will ſtill hang on the Church, as long as Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Ambition ferment ſo ſtrongly in the minds of Church-men.</p>
               <p>A Bill was ſent to the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſigned by the King,

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170737:260"/>ſome imputed to a Jealouſie, he had of his firſt Wife, and others aſcribed it to the power his ſecond Wife had over him. But the Commons were very unwilling to void a ſettlement confirmed in Parliament, and ſo for Fifteen days it was debated: A new Bill was deviſed, and that was much altered, and the Bill was not finiſhed till the day before the diſſolution of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. The Lords added a Proviſo, confirming the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi>'s Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that was caſt out by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Some Writings had been ſealed with relation to a Marriage between the Earl of <hi>Hartford,</hi> the Dukes Son, and the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi>'s Daughter, and the Lords ſent down a Bill voiding theſe, but upon a diviſion in the Houſe of Commons, 68. were for it, and 69. were againſt it; ſo it was caſt out. The Houſe was now thin, when we find but 137. Members in it: but that is one of the effects of a long Parliament: many grow infirm, and many keep out of the way on deſign, and thoſe who at their firſt Election were the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the People, after they have ſat long, become a Cabal of Men, that purſue their own Intereſts,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tonſtall</hi> is impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> more than the Publick Service. <hi>Tonſtall</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> upon ſome Informations, was put in Priſon in the former year: The Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> intended to erect a great Principality for his Family in the North; and the acceſſion of the Juriſdiction of the County <hi>Palatine,</hi> which is in that See,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170737:260"/>ſeemed ſo conſiderable, that he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ruine <hi>Tonſtall,</hi> and ſo make way for that. He complied in all the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that were made, though he had proteſted againſt them in Parliament; he writ alſo for the Corporal Preſence, but with more Eloquence than Learning: He was a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and moderate Man, and there was always a good correſpondence between <hi>Cranmer</hi> and him: and now when the Bill was put in againſt him, he oppoſed it, and proteſted againſt it, by which he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely loſt the Duke of <hi>Northumberland:</hi> but all the Popiſh complying Biſhops went along with it. There were ſome Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions read in the Houſe of Lords to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie it, but when the Bill with theſe was ſent down to the Commons, they reſolved to put a ſtop to that way of condemning Men without hearing them: ſo they ſent a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Lords, that he and his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers might be heard face to face, and that not being done, they let the Bill fall. By theſe Indications, it appeared that the Houſe of Commons had little kindneſs for the Duke of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> Many of them had been much obliged to the Duke of <hi>Somerſet;</hi> ſo it was reſolved to have a new Parliament, and this which had ſat almoſt five years, was on the 15th. of <hi>April</hi> diſſolved.</p>
               <p>The Convocation did confirm the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion,
<note place="margin">A Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Laws prepared.</note> that had been prepared the former year, and thus was the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Worſhip and Doctrine now
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170737:261"/>brought to ſuch perfection, that ſince that time there has been very little alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made in theſe. But another Branch of it was yet unfiniſhed, and was now under conſultation, touching the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, and the rules of the Eccleſiaſtical Courts. Two Acts had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the former reign, and one in this, impowering XXXII. to reviſe all the Laws of the Church, and digeſt them into a body. King <hi>Henry</hi> iſſued out a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the Perſons were named, who made ſome progreſs in it, as appears by ſome of <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Letters to him. In this Reign it had been begun ſeveral times, but the Changes in the Government made it be laid aſide. Thirty two were found to be too many for preparing the firſt draught, ſo Eight were appointed to make it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for them: Theſe were <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley, Cox</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr, Traheron</hi> and <hi>Taylor,</hi> and <hi>Lucas</hi> and <hi>Goſnold,</hi> two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, two Divines, two Civilians, and two Common Lawyers; but it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believed, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> drew it all himſelf, and the reſt only corrected what he deſigned. <hi>Haddon</hi> and <hi>Cheek</hi> were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to put it in <hi>Latine;</hi> in which they ſucceeded ſo well, and arrived at ſo true a purity in the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtile, that it looks like a work of the beſt Ages of that State, before their Language was corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the mixture of barbarous terms and phraſes, with which all the later Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings were filled, but none were more nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouſly
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170737:261"/>rude than the Books of the Canon-Law. The Work was caſt into fifty one Titles, perhaps it was deſigned to bring it near the number of the Books, into which <hi>Juſtinian</hi> digeſted the <hi>Roman</hi> Law. The Eight finiſhed it, and offered it to the XXXII. who divided themſelves into Four Claſſes, every one was to offer his Corrections, and when it had paſt through them all, it was to be offered to the King for his Confirmation; but the King died before it was quite finiſhed, nor was it ever after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taken up: yet I ſhall think it no uſeleſs part of this work, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what was intended to be done in this matter, as well as I relate what was done in other things.</p>
               <p>The firſt Title of it was concerning the Catholick Faith:
<note place="margin">The heads of it.</note> it was made Capital to deny the Chriſtian Religion. The Books of Scripture were reckoned up, and the Apocrypha left out. The four firſt General Councils were received, but both Councils and Fathers were to be ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, only as they agreed with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. The ſecond enumerates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns many Hereſies, extracted out of the Opinions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Tenets of the Anabaptiſts: and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, thoſe who excuſed their lives, by the pretence of Predeſtination, are reckoned up. 3. The judgment of Hereſie was to lye in the Biſhops Court, except in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted places. Perſons ſuſpected might be required to purge themſelves, and thoſe
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170737:262"/>who were convicted, were to abjure and do Penance, but ſuch as were obſtinate, were declared Infamous, and not to have the benefit of the Law, or of making Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, and ſo all Capital proceedings for Hereſie were laid aſide. 4. Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt God was to be puniſhed as obſtinate Hereſie. 5. The Sacraments, and other parts of the Paſtoral Charge, were to be decently performed. 6. All Magick, Idolatry, or Conjuring was to be puniſhed arbitrarily, and in caſe of obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, with Excommunication. 7. Biſhops were appointed once a Year to call all their Clergy together, to examine them concerning their Flocks: and Itinerant Preachers were to be often imployed for viſiting ſuch Precincts as might be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their care. 8. All Marriages were to be after asking of Banes, and to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled, if not done according to the Book of Common Prayer. Corrupters of Virgins were to marry them; or if that could not be done, to give them the third part of their Goods, and ſuffer Corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Marriages made by force, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſent of Parents, were declared null. Polygamy was forbid, and Mothers were required to ſuckle their Children. 9. The degrees of Marriage were ſetled accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, but ſpiritual kindred was to be no barr. 10. A Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man guilty of Adultery, was to forfeit his Goods and Eſtate to his Wife and Children, or to ſome pious uſe; and to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170737:262"/>be baniſhed or Impriſoned during life: a Layman guilty of it, was to forfeit the half, and be baniſhed or Impriſoned du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life: Wives that were guilty, were to be puniſhed in the ſame manner. The Innocent Party might marry again after a Divorce. Deſertion, or Mortal Enmity, or the conſtant perverſneſs of a Husband, might induce a Divorce, but little quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, nor a perpetual Diſeaſe might not do it; and the ſeparation from Bed and Board, except during a Trial, was never to be allowed. 11. Patrons were charged to give preſentations, without making bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains; to chooſe the fitteſt perſons, and not to make promiſes till the Livings were vacant. The Biſhops were required to uſe great ſtrictneſs in the Trial of thoſe, whom they ordained: all Pluralities and Non-reſidence were condemned, and all that were preſented were to purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of Simony by Oath. The twelfth and thirteenth were concerning the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Benefices. The fourteenth was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner of purgation upon common fame: all ſuperſtitious Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were condemned. Others followed, about Dilapidations, Elections and Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The nineteenth was concerning Divine Offices. The Communion was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be every Sunday in Cathedrals, and a Sermon was to be in them in the afternoon: ſuch as received the Sacrament, were to give notice to the Miniſter the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he might examine their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences:
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170737:263"/>The Catechiſm was appointed to be explained for an Hour in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon on Holy-days: After the Evening Prayer, the Poor were to be taken care of, Penances were to be enjoyned to ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Perſons, and the Miniſter was to confer with ſome of the Ancients of the People, concerning the ſtate of the Pariſh, That admonitions and cenſures might be applied, as there was occaſion given. The twentieth was concerning other Church-Officers. A Rural Dean was to be in every Precinct to watch over the Clergy, according to the Biſhops directions: Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons were to be over them, and the Biſhop over all: who was to have yearly Synods, and viſit every third Year. His Family was to conſiſt of Clergymen, in imitation of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and other ancient Biſhops, theſe he was to train up, for the ſervice of the Church: When Biſhops became infirm, they were to have Co-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutors: Arch-biſhops were to do the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal duties in their Dioceſs, and to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit their Province. Every Synod was to begin with a Communion, and after that the Miniſters were to give an account of their Pariſhes, and follow ſuch directions as the Biſhop ſhould give them. Other heads followed concerning Church-Wardens; Tithes, Univerſities, Viſitations, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of Cenſures. In the thirtieth, a large Scheme was drawn of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which was intruſted to Church-men, for keeping the Church pure, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170737:263"/>was not to be inflicted, but for obſtinacy in ſome groſs fault: all cauſes upon which it was pronounced, were to be examined before the Miniſter of the Pariſh, a Juſtice of Peace, and ſome other Church-men. It was to be pronounced and intimated with great ſeriouſneſs, and all were to be warned not to keep company with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cenſured, under the like pains, except thoſe of his own Family: Upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing forty days obſtinate under it, a Writ was to be iſſued out for Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till the Sentence ſhould be taken off. Such as had the King's Pardon for Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal offences, were yet liable to Church cenſures. Then followed the Office of abſolving Penitents. They were to come to the Church-door, and crave admittance, and the Miniſter having brought them in, was to read a long diſcourſe concerning Sin, Repentance, and the Mercies of God. Then the Party was to confeſs his ſin, and to ask God, and the Congregation pardon; upon which the Miniſter was to lay his hands on his Head, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Abſolution. Then a thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving was to be offered to God, at the Communion Table, for the reclaiming that ſinner. The other Heads of this work, relate to the other parts of the Law of thoſe Courts. It is certain, that the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Vice and Impiety, flows in a great meaſure from the want of that ſtrictneſs of cenſure, which was the glory of the Chriſtian Church in the Primitive times:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170737:264"/>and it is a publick connivance at ſin, that there have not been more effectual ways taken for making ſinners aſhamed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them the Priviledges of Chriſtians, till they have changed their ill courſe of life.</p>
               <p>There were at this time alſo remedies under conſideration,
<note place="margin">The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</note> for the great miſery and poverty the Clergy were generally in: but the Laity were ſo much concerned to oppoſe all theſe, that there was no hope of bringing them to any good effect, till the King ſhould come to be of Age him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and endeavour to recover again a competent maintenance, for the Clergy, out of their hands, who had devoured their Revenues. Both <hi>Heath</hi> and <hi>Day,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> were this Year deprived of their Biſhopricks, by a Court of Delegates, that were all Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. But it does not appear, for what offences they were ſo cenſured. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and <hi>Worceſter</hi> were both united, and put under <hi>Hooper</hi>'s care; but ſoon after, the former was made an exempted Archdeaconry, and he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Biſhop only of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> In every See, as it fell vacant, the beſt Mannors were laid hold on by ſuch hungry Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, as had the Intereſt to procure the Grant of them. It was thought, that the Biſhops Sees were ſo out of Meaſure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, that they could never be made poor enough: but ſuch haſt was made in ſpoiling them, that they were reduced to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170737:264"/>ſo low a condition, that it was hardly poſſible for a Biſhop to ſubſiſt in them. If what had been thus taken from them, had been converted to good uſes, ſuch as the ſupplying the Inferiour Clergy, it had been ſome mitigation of ſo heinous a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery: But their Lands were ſnatched up by Laymen, who thought of making no Compenſation to the Church for the ſpoils thus made by them.</p>
               <p>This Year the Reformation had ſome more footing in <hi>Ireland</hi> than formerly.
<note place="margin">Affairs in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. had aſſumed to himſelf, by conſent of the Parliament of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Title of <hi>King of Ireland:</hi> the former Kings of <hi>England</hi> having only been called <hi>Lords</hi> of it. The Popes and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours have pretended, that ſuch Titles could be given only by them: The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſaid, all power in Heaven and Earth was given to Chriſt, and by conſequence to his Vicar. The latter, as carrying the Title of <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, pretended, that as they Anciently beſtowed thoſe Titles, ſo that devolved on them, who retained only the name and ſhadow of that Great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But Princes and States have thought that they may bring themſelves under what Titles they pleaſe. In <hi>Ireland,</hi> though the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were well obeyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pale, yet the <hi>Iriſh</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued barbarous and unciviliſed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the heads of their Names or Tribes, and were obedient, or did rebel as they directed them. In <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> they had
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170737:265"/>a great dependance on <hi>Scotland:</hi> and there were ſome riſings there, during the War with <hi>Scotland,</hi> which were quieted, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Leading-men Penſions, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to come and live within the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pale. <hi>Monluc,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> being then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> went over thither to engage them to raiſe new Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but that had no effect: while he was there, his laſciviouſneſs came to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by an odd accident, for a Whore was brought to him by ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, and ſecretly kept by him: but ſhe ſearching among his Clothes, fell on a Glaſs, full of ſomewhat, that was very odoriferous, and drank it off; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered by the Biſhop, too late, put him in a moſt violent paſſion: for it had been given him, as a Preſent, by <hi>Soliman</hi> the Magnificent, when he was Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour at his Court. It was call'd the richeſt balm of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and valued at 2000. Crowns. His rage grew ſo boiſterous, that all about him, diſcovered both his Paſſion, and Lewdneſs at once. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was ſet up in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pale, but had made a ſmall progreſs among the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> This Year <hi>Bale</hi> was ſent over to labour among them. He was a buſie Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and was a Learned zealous Man, but did not write with the temper and decency that became a Divine. <hi>Goodaker</hi> was ſent to be Primate of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and he was to be Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory.</hi> Two <hi>Iriſh</hi> Men were alſo promoted with them; who
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170737:265"/>undertook to advance the Reformation there. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have ordained them by the old Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical, and all, except <hi>Bale,</hi> were willing it ſhould be ſo, but he prevailed that it ſhould be done according to the new book of Ordinations: after that he went into his Dioceſs, but found all there in dark Popery, and before he could make any Progreſs,
<note place="margin">A Change in the Garter.</note> the King's death put an end to his deſigns. There was a change ſetled in the Order of the Garter this Year. A Propoſition was made the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer year, to conſider how the Order might be freed from the Superſtition, that was ſuppoſed to be in it. St. <hi>George</hi>'s fighting with a Dragon, lookt like a Legend for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in dark Ages, to ſupport the humour of Chivalry, then very high in the world. The ſtory was neither credible in it ſelf, nor vouched by any good Author: nor was there any of that name mentioned by the Ancients, but <hi>George</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhop, that was put in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> when <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was baniſhed. Some Knights were appointed to prepare a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Order: and the Earl of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland,</hi> and Sir <hi>Andrew Dudley</hi> were this Year Inſtalled according to the New Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del. It was appointed to be called in all time coming, the Order of the <hi>Garter,</hi> and no more the Order of St. <hi>George;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the former <hi>George,</hi> there was to be on the one ſide of the Jewel, a Man on Horſeback, with a Bible on his Swords
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170737:266"/>point: On the Sword was written <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio,</hi> and on the Bible <hi>Verbum Dei;</hi> and on the Reverſe a Shield, and <hi>Fides</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon it: to ſhew that they would maintain the Word of God, both with offenſive and defenſive Weapons: but all this was reverſed by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and the old Statutes were again revived, which continue to this day.</p>
               <p>There was at this time a ſtrict enquiry made into the accounts of all,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlands</hi> ſeverity.</note> who had been imployed in the former part of this Reign; for it was believed, that the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors had embezel'd much of the Plate of the Churches: and theſe were the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> which made <hi>Northumberland</hi> proſecute them more vehemently: On none did this fall more ſeverely, than on the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> who was not only fined in 6000 <hi>l.</hi> but was degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Order of the Garter, with a particular mark of Infamy on his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; yet he was afterwards reſtored to it with as much honour. He had been a conſtant friend to the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and that made his Enemies execute ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a Revenge on him. <hi>Northumberland</hi> was preparing matters for a Parliament, and being a Man of an Inſolent temper, no leſs abject when he was low, than lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with proſperity, he thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſeverity was the only way to bring the Nation eaſily to comply with his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of affairs; but this, though
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170737:266"/>it ſucceeded for ſome time, yet when he needed it moſt, it turned violently upon him: for nothing can work on a free People ſo much, as Juſtice and Clemency in the Government.</p>
               <p>A great deſign was ſetled this Year,
<note place="margin">Trade flouriſhes much.</note> which proved to be the foundation of all that Wealth and Trade, that has ſince that time flouriſhed ſo much in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Henry</hi> the III. had been much ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in his Wars, by the aſſiſtance he got from the Free-Towns of <hi>Germany,</hi> in recompence of which he gave them great Priviledges in <hi>England.</hi> They were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med here in a Corporation, and lived in the <hi>Still</hi> Yard near <hi>London</hi>-Bridge. They had gone ſometimes beyond their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which were thereupon judged to be forfeited, but by great Preſents they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed new ones. They traded in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſo ruined others by under ſelling them; and by making Preſents at <hi>Court,</hi> or lending great Summs, they had the Government on their ſide. Trade was now riſing much, Courts began to be more Magnificent, ſo that there was a greater conſumption, particularly of Cloth, than formerly. <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh</hi> lying, the one near the mouth of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the other at the mouth of the <hi>Elbe,</hi> had then the chief Trade in theſe Parts of the World; and their Factors in the <hi>Still</hi>-Yard, had all the Markets in <hi>England</hi> in their hands; and ſet ſuch Prices, both on
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170737:267"/>what they imported or exported, as they pleaſed, and broke all other Merchants to ſuch a degree, that the former Year they had ſhipped 44000. Clothes, and all the other Traders had not ſhipped above 1100. So the Merchant-adventurers complained of the <hi>Still</hi>-Yard Men, and after ſome hearings, it was judged that they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their Charter, and that their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was diſſolved: nor could all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of the <hi>Hanſe</hi> Towns, ſeconded by the Emperour's Interceſſion, procure them a new Charter. But a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was propoſed, after this was ſetled; which was to open two free <hi>Mart</hi> Towns in <hi>England,</hi> and to give them ſuch Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as the free Towns in the Empire had, and by that means to draw the Trade to <hi>England: Southampton</hi> and <hi>Hull</hi> were thought the fitteſt. This was ſo far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by the young King, that he writ a large Paper, ballancing the conveniencies and inconveniencies of it, but all that fell with his Life.</p>

Nor was he ignorant of Logick, of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Natural Philoſophy, nor of Muſick; The ſweetneſs of his Temper was ſuch as became a Mortal, his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity becoming the Majeſty of a King, and his Diſpoſition was ſuitable to his high Degree: In ſum, that Child was ſo bred, had ſuch parts, and was of ſuch expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he looked like a Miracle of a Man: Theſe things are not ſpoken Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torically, and beyond the Truth, but are indeed ſhort of it.</q> And afterwards he adds, <q rend="inline">He was a marvellous Boy; when I was with him, he was in the 15th. year of his Age, in which he ſpake <hi>Latin</hi> as politely, and as promptly as I did: He asked me, what was the ſubject of my Book, <hi>de Rerum varietate,</hi> which I dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him? I anſwered, that in the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170737:268"/>firſt Chapter, I gave the true cauſe of Comets, which had been long enquired into, but was never found out before. What is it, ſaid he? I ſaid, it was the concourſe of the Light of wandring Stars. He anſwered, How can that be, ſince the Stars move in different moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? How comes it that the Comets are not ſoon diſſipated, or do not move af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, according to their motions. To this I anſwered, they do move after them, but much quicker than they, by reaſon of the different aſpect, as we ſee in Cryſtal, or when a Rain-bow rebounds from a Wall: for a little change makes a great difference of place. But the King ſaid, How can that be, where there is no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to receive that Light, as the Wall is the ſubject for the Rain-bow? To this I anſwered, That this was as in the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky way, or where many Candles were lighted, the middle place, where their ſhining met, was white and clear. From this little taſt, it may be imagined what he was. And indeed the ingenuity, and ſweetneſs of his Diſpoſition had raiſed in all good, and learned Men the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt expectation of him poſſible. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to love the Liberal Arts before he knew them, and to know them before he could uſe them: and in him there was ſuch an Attempt of Nature, that not only <hi>England,</hi> but the World hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to lament his being ſo early ſnatcht away. How truly was it ſaid of ſuch
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170737:268"/>extraordinary Perſons, that their Lives are ſhort, and ſeldom do they come to be old? He gave us an Eſſay of Vertue, though he did not live to give a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of it. When the gravity of a King was needful, he carried himſelf like an old Man, and yet he was always affable, and gentle, as became his Age. He played on the Lute; he medled in affairs of State: and for Bounty, he did in that emulate his Father; though he, even when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be too good, might appear to have been bad: but there was no ground of ſuſpecting any ſuch thing in the Son, whoſe mind was cultivated by the ſtudy of Philoſophy.</q>

               <p>In <hi>Scotland</hi> there was a great change in the Government:
<note place="margin">Affairs in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> the Governor was dealt with, to reſign it to the Queen Dowager, who returned this Year from <hi>France,</hi> and was treated with all that reſpect that was due to her rank, as ſhe paſt through <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> She brought Letters to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, adviſing him to reſign it to her, but in ſuch terms, that he ſaw he muſt either do it, or maintain his power by force: he was a ſoft Man, and was the more eaſily wrought on, becauſe his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Brother was then deſperately ill: but when he recovered, and found what
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170737:269"/>he had done, he expreſſed his diſpleaſure at it in very vehement terms. The young Queen of <hi>Scotlands</hi> Uncles propoſed a Match for her with the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> which had been long in diſcourſe, and the King of <hi>France</hi> inclined much to it. Conſtable <hi>Monmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy</hi> oppoſed it: He obſerved how much <hi>Spain</hi> ſuffered, in having ſo many Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries at a diſtance: though thoſe were the beſt Provinces of <hi>Europe.</hi> So he reckoned the keeping <hi>Scotland,</hi> would coſt <hi>France</hi> more than ever it could be worth: A Revolt to <hi>England</hi> would be eaſie, and the ſending Fleets and Armies thither would be a vaſt charge: He therefore adviſed the King, rather to marry her to ſome of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Blood, and to ſend them to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo by a ſmall Penſion, that Kingdom would be preſerved in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of <hi>France.</hi> But the Conſtable was a known Enemy to the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and ſo thoſe wiſe advices were little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and were imputed to the fears he had of ſo great a ſtrengthning, as this would have given to their Intereſt at Court. In <hi>Scotland</hi> there were now two Factions: the one was headed by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, and all the Clergy were in it, who were jealous of the Queen, as leaning too much to ſome Lords, who were believed to incline to the Reformation; of whom the Prior of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> afterwards the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> was the chief: Theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſerve the Queen in all her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; in particular, in ſending the Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170737:269"/>Crown to <hi>France,</hi> upon their young Queens Marriage with the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> if ſhe would defend them from the Violence of the Clergy in matters of Religion, which being made generally ſubſervient to other Intereſts in all Courts, this was well enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Queen, though ſhe was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very zealous in her own Religion.</p>
               <p>There was a great and unexpected turn this year, in the affairs of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The affairs in <hi>Germany:</hi>
                  </note> The Emperour's Miniſters began to entertain ſome jealouſie of <hi>Maurice,</hi> ſo that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> adviſed the Emperour to call for him, and ſo to take him off from the head of the Army; and then make him give an account of ſome ſuſpicious paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in his treating with other Princes: but the Biſhop of <hi>Arras</hi> ſaid, he had both his Secretaries in pay, and he knew by their means all his Negotiations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied ſo on their Intelligence, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with the Emperour not to provoke him, by ſeeming diſtruſtful of him. But <hi>Maurice</hi> knew all this, and deluded his Secretaries, ſo that he ſeemed to open to them all his ſecreteſt Negotiations; yet he really let them know nothing, but what he was willing ſhould come to the Emperor's ears, and had managed his Treaties ſo ſecretly, that they had not the leaſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of them. At laſt the Emperour was ſo poſſeſt with the Advertiſements that were ſent him from all parts, that he writ to <hi>Maurice</hi> to come and clear
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170737:270"/>himſelf; and then he refined it higher: for he preſently left the Army, and took Poſt, with one of his Secretaries, and a ſmall Retinue: after a Days riding, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of a pain in his ſide, ſo that he could not go on, but ſent his Secretary with his excuſes: This appearance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence made the Emperour lay down all his jealouſies of him. He had alſo ſent his Ambaſſadours to <hi>Trent,</hi> and had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and ſome Divines to follow them ſlowly, and as ſoon as a ſafe conduct was obtained, to go to <hi>Trent.</hi> The Emperour's Agents had a hard task, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Legats and the <hi>Lutherans:</hi> they dealt with the Legates to hear the other; but they anſwered, that it was againſt the rules of the Church, to treat with profeſſed Hereticks. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> on the other hand, made ſuch high demands, that they had as much to do to moderate them: they preſt them not to ask too much at once, and promiſed, that if they would proceed prudently, the Emperour would concur with them, to pull down the Popes power, and to reform abuſes. A Safe-Conduct was demanded, ſuch as had been granted by the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> that their Divines might have a deciſive voice, and the free exerciſe of their Religion, and that all things might be examined according to the Scriptures. But the Legates abhorred the name of that Council, that had acted ſo much againſt the Papal authority, and had granted ſuch
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170737:270"/>a Conduct, that ſo they might unite <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and engage the Empire to joyn with them againſt the Pope. The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours from the <hi>Lutherans</hi> were heard in a General Congregation, where they gave the Council a very cold Complement, and deſired a Safe-Conduct. The Pope under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the Emperor was reſolved to ſet on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops, to bear down the power of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he united himſelf to <hi>France,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to break the Council on the firſt occaſion, upon which he ordered the Legates to proceed to ſettle the doctrine; hoping the Proteſtants would upon that deſpair of favour, and go away. But while theſe things were in agitation, the War of <hi>Germany</hi> broke out, and the Legates ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended the Council for two Years.</p>

<note place="margin">An Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </note> I ſhall have no occaſion to ſpeak more of this Council, ſo I ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this remark here, that this Council had been much deſired both by Princes and Biſhops, in hopes that differences of Religion would have been compoſed in it, and that the Corruptions of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would have been reformed by it, and that had made the Popes very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of it: but ſuch was the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Legates, the number of <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops, and the diſſenſions of the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> that it had effects quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what all ſides expected. The breach in Religion was put paſt reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170737:271"/>by the poſitive deciſions they made: the abuſes of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Proviſo's, made in favours of the Priviledges of the Apoſtolick See: and the World was ſo cured of their longings for a General Council, that none has been deſired ſince that time. The Hiſtory of that Council was writ with great exactneſs and Judgment, by Father <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> while the thing was yet freſh in all Mens memories; and though it diſcovered the whole ſecret of tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions there, yet none ſet himſelf to write againſt it, for Forty Years after: of late then <hi>Pallavicini</hi> undertook it, and upon the credit of many Memorials, he in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things contradicts Father <hi>Paul;</hi> but as many of theſe are likely enough to be forged, ſo in the main of the Hiſtory, they both agree ſo far, that it is manifeſt, things were not fairly carried, and that all matters were managed by Intreagues and ſecret practices, in which it will be very hard to diſcern ſuch a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Holy Ghoſt, as ſhould induce the World to ſubmit to their authority: and indeed <hi>Pallavicini</hi> was aware of this, and therefore he lays down this for a foundation; <q rend="inline">That there muſt be a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality in the Church, ſupported by great Wealth and Dignity; and many practices are now neceſſary that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what were in the Primitive time, which was the Infancy of the Church, and ought not to be a rule to it now,

                  <hi>Maurice</hi> declared for the liberty of <hi>Germany,</hi> and took <hi>Ausburg,</hi>

The King of <hi>France</hi> fell alſo in, upon the Empire, with a great Force, and by ſurpriſe made himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Metz, Toul</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> and thought to have got <hi>Strasburg. Maurice</hi> ſent his demands to the Emperour for the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave's liberty, and for reſtoring the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Empire: and the Emperour being ſlow in making anſwer, he marched on to <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> where he ſurpriſed a Poſt, and was within two Miles of him, before he was aware of it, ſo that the Emperor was forced to fly away by Torch-light: and from thence went to <hi>Italy.</hi> Thus that very Army and Prince, that had been chiefly Inſtrumental in the ruine of the Empire, did now again aſſert its freedom; and all the Emperor's great deſign on <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> was now ſo blaſted, that he could never after this put any life in it: he was forced to diſcharge his Priſoners, and to call in the Proſcriptions, and after ſome Treaty, at laſt the Edict of <hi>Paſſaw</hi> was made, by which the free exerciſe of the Proteſtant Religion was granted to the Princes and Towns: and ſo did that ſtorm, which had almoſt overwhelmed the Princes of that Perſwaſion end, without any other conſiderable effect, beſides the Tranſlation of the Electoral dignity from <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Maurice.</hi> The Emperour's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes encreaſed on him, for againſt all
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170737:272"/>reaſon he beſieged <hi>Metz</hi> in <hi>December,</hi> but after he had ruined his Army in it, he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to raiſe the Siege. Upon that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into <hi>Flanders,</hi> in ſuch diſcontent, that for ſome time he would admit none to come to him. Here it was believed, he firſt formed that deſign, which ſome years after he put in execution, of forſaking the World, and exchanging the Pomp of a Court, with the retirement of a Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This ſtrange and unlookt for turn in his affairs, gave a great demonſtration of an over-ruling Providence, that governs all humane affairs, and of that particular care that God had of the Reformation, in recovering it, when it ſeemed to be gone, without all hope, in <hi>Germany.</hi>

               <p>In the beginning of this Year,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1553"/> there was a regulation made of the Privy Council. Several Committees had proper work aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them, and directions given them for their conduct; of which there is an account extant, corrected with King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s hand. A new Parliament was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſat down the firſt of <hi>March;</hi> a motion was made for a Subſidy of two tenths, and two fifteenths to be paid in two years: at the paſſing of the Bill there was a great debate about it in the Houſe of Commons, which ſeems to have been concerning the Preamble, for it contained a high accuſation of the Duke of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi>'s adminiſtration, and was ſet on by the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s Party, to let the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170737:272"/>King ſee how well pleaſed the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of the Nation was with his fall.</p>
               <p>The Sons of the Nobility and Gentry had ordinarily Prebends given them,
<note place="margin">A Bill propoſed that Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould not hold Church-dignities.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this pretence, that they intended to follow their ſtudies, and make themſelves capable of entring into Orders: and this was like to become a great prejudice to the Clergy, when ſo many of the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Church were in Lay-hands. Upon this the Biſhops procured a Bill to be paſt in the Houſe of Lords, that none might hold theſe, that was not either Prieſt or Deacon: but at the third read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Commons threw it out.</p>
               <p>Another Bill paſt for ſuppreſſing the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Act ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Biſhop of <hi>Durham.</hi>
                  </note> and erecting two new Sees, the one at <hi>Durham,</hi> and the other at <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> the former was to have 2000. and the latter 1000. Marks Revenue; there was alſo a Dean and a Chapter to be endowed at <hi>Newcaſtle.

The King granted a General
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170737:273"/>Pardon, in which the Commons moved the Lords, that ſome words might be put, though that is not uſual to be done; for Acts of Pardon, are commonly paſt without any Changes made in them: After the paſſing theſe Acts, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was diſſolved on the laſt of <hi>March.</hi> For it ſeems either the Duke of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> was not pleaſed with the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Houſe of Commons, or he was reſolved to call frequent Parliaments, and not continue the ſame, as the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> had done.</p>
               <p>Viſitors were ſent after this to examine what Plate was in every Church,
<note place="margin">Another Viſitation.</note> and to leave them one or two Chalices of Silver, with Linnen, for the Communion-Table, and for Surplices, and to bring in all other things of value to the Treaſurer of the King's Houſhold, and to ſell the reſt, and give it to the Poor. This was a new rifling of Churches, by which it ſeemed ſome reſolved not to ceaſe, till they had brought them to a Primitive Poverty, as well as the Reformers intended to bring them to a Primitive purity. The King ſet his hand to theſe Inſtructions, from which ſome have inferred, that he was ill principled in himſelf, when at ſuch an Age, he joyned his Authority to ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. But he was now ſo ill, that it is probable, he ſet his hand to every thing, that the Council ſent him, without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining anxiouſly what it might import.</p>

                  <hi>Ferrar</hi> was put in St. <hi>Davids,</hi> upon <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>'s removal: he was an indiſcreet Man, and drew upon himſelf the diſlike of his Prebendaries, and many complaints were made of him, which, if true, diſcovered great weakneſs in him: at laſt he was ſued in a <hi>Premunire,</hi> for acting in his own name, and not in the King's, in his Courts; and was put in Priſon, where he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, till <hi>Morgan,</hi> that was his chief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, being put in his place by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> condemned him to the Fire; which turned all former Cenſures, that he had given occaſion for, by his ſimplicity, into eſteem and compaſſion. By theſe Patents, the Epiſcopal Power was ſtill declared to flow from Chriſt; they were only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations to Biſhopricks, ſuch as other Patrons gave to inferiour Benefices; and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170737:274"/>ſuch as Chriſtian Princes in <hi>France,</hi> and other Kingdoms gave in elder times, for Biſhopricks.

The King was much touched with this; ſo, after Sermon, he ſent for the Biſhop, and treated him with ſuch reſpect, that he made him ſit down, and be covered: then he told him, what Impreſſion his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation had made on him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſired to be directed by him, how to do his duty in that matter. <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> took a little time to conſider of it, and after ſome conſultation with the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> he brought the King a Scheme of ſeveral Foundations, one for the ſick and wounded, another for ſuch as were wilfully idle, or were mad, and a third for Orphans: ſo he endowed St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s Hoſpital for the firſt, <hi>Bridewell</hi> for the ſecond, and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Church near <hi>Newgate</hi> for the third; and he enlarged the Grant he made the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer year, for St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Hoſpital in <hi>Southwark.</hi> The Statutes and Warrants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to theſe, were not finiſhed before the 26. of <hi>June,</hi> though he gave order to make all the haſt that was poſſible:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170737:275"/>and when he ſet his hand to them, he bleſt God that had prolonged his life, till he finiſhed his deſigns concerning them.

               <p>The King bore his ſickneſs with great ſubmiſſion to the will of God;
<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents for the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Crown.</note> and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerned in nothing ſo much, as the ſtate that Religion, and the Church would be in, after his death. The Duke of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> had only three Daughters, the eldeſt of theſe was now married to Lord <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Dudley;</hi> the ſecond to the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s eldeſt Son; and the third, that was crooked, to one <hi>Keys.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> for ſtrengthning his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, married alſo his own two Daughters, the one to Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> and the other to the Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi>'s eldeſt Son. He grew to be much hated by the People, and the jealouſie of the King's being poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, was faſtened on him. But he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded theſe things little, and reſolved to improve the fears the King was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion, to the advantage of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Jane.</hi> The King was eaſily perſwaded to order the Judges, and his Learned Council to put ſome Articles, which he had ſigned, for the ſucceſſion of the Crown, in the common form of Law. They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170737:276"/>that the Succeſſion being ſetled by Act of Parliament, could not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, except by Parliament: yet the King required them to do what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them. But next time they came to the Council, they declared, that it was made Treaſon to change the Succeſſion by an Act paſt in this Reign, ſo they could not meddle with it. <hi>Mountague</hi> was chief Juſtice, and ſpake in the name of the reſt. <hi>Northumberland</hi> fell out in a great paſſion againſt him, calling him <hi>Traitor,</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to obey the King's commands: for that is always the language of an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miniſter, when he acts againſt Law. But the Judges were not ſhaken by his threatnings; ſo they were again brought before the King, who ſharply rebuked them for their delays, but they ſaid, all that they could do, would be of no force, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Parliament, yet they were required to do it, in the beſt manner they could: At laſt <hi>Mountague</hi> deſired they might have a Pardon for what they were to do, &amp; that being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, all the Judges, except <hi>Goſnald</hi> and <hi>Hales,</hi> agreed to the Patent, &amp; deliver'd their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the Lord Chancellor might put the Seal to it, and that then it would be good in Law; yet the former of theſe two was at laſt wrought on, ſo <hi>Hales</hi> was the only Man that ſtood out to the laſt: who, though he was a zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, yet would not give his Opinion againſt his Conſcience, upon any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whatſoever. The Privy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170737:276"/>were next required to ſet their hand to it: <hi>Cecyl,</hi> in a Relation he writ of this tranſaction, ſays, that hearing ſome of the Judges declare ſo poſitively, that it was againſt Law, he refuſed to ſet his hand to it, as a Privy Councellour, but ſigned it only as a Witneſs to the King's ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſtood out long, he came not to Council when it was paſt there, and refuſed to conſent to it, when he was preſt to it; for he ſaid, he would never have a hand in diſinheriting his late Maſter's Daughters. The young dying King was at laſt ſet on him, and by his Importunity prevailed with him to do it, and ſo the Seal was put to the Patents. The King's diſtemper continued to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſo that the Phyſicians deſpaired of his Recovery. A confident Woman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook his Cure, and he was put in her hands, but ſhe left him worſe than ſhe found him; and this heightned the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> that had introduced her, and put the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans away. At laſt, to Crown his deſigns, he got the King to write to his Siſters, to come and divert him in his ſickneſs: and the matter of the Excluſion had been carried ſo ſecretly, that they apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no danger, had begun their Journey.</p>
               <p>In the 6th. of <hi>July,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Kings death and Character.</note> the King felt death approaching, and prepared himſelf for it, in a moſt devout manner: He was often heard offering up Prayers and Ejaculations
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170737:277"/>to God: Particularly a few Moments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, he prayed earneſtly that God would take him out of this wretched life, and committed his Spirit to him, he interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded very fervently for his Subjects, that God would preſerve <hi>England</hi> from Popery, and maintain his true Religion among them; ſoon after that, he breathed out his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Soul, being in Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi>'s arms. Endeavours were uſed to conceal his death, for ſome days, on deſign to draw his Siſters into the ſnare, before they ſhould be aware of it, but that could not be done.</p>
               <p>Thus died <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. in the ſixteenth Year of his Age. He was counted the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that time: he was not only Learned in the Tongues, and the Liberal Sciences, but knew well the ſtate of his Kingdom. He kept a Table-Book, in which he had writ the Characters of all the eminent Men of the Nation; he ſtudied Fortification, and underſtood the Mint well: he knew the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in all his Dominions, with the depth of Water, and way of coming into them. He underſtood foreign affairs ſo well, that the Ambaſſadours that were ſent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> publiſhed very extraordinary things of him, in all the Courts of <hi>Europe.</hi> He had great quickneſs of apprehenſion, but being diſtruſtful of his Memory, he took Notes of every thing he heard, that was conſiderable, in <hi>Greek</hi> Characters; that thoſe about him might not underſtand what he writ, which he afterwards Copied out fair in the Journal that he kept.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:170737:277"/>
               <p>His Virtues were wonderful, when he was made believe, that his Unkle was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſpiring the death of the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours, he upon that abandoned him. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naby Fitzpatrick</hi> was his Favourite, and when he ſent him to travel, he writ oft to him, to keep good Company, to avoid exceſs and Luxury, and to improve himſelf in thoſe things, that might render him capable of Imployment, at his return. He was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made Lord of Upper <hi>Oſſory</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and did anſwer the hopes that this excellent King had of him. He was very merciful in his nature, which appeared in his unwillingneſs to ſign the Warrant, for burning the Maid of <hi>Kent.</hi> He took great care to have his debts well paid, reckoning that a Prince who breaks his Faith, and loſes his Credit, has thrown up that which he can never recover, and made himſelf liable to perpetual diſtruſt, and extreme contempt. He took ſpecial care of the Petitions, that were given him by poor and oppreſt People. But his great zeal for Religion crowned all the reſt. It was not only an angry heat about it that acted him, but it was a true tenderneſs of conſcience, founded on the love of <hi>God,</hi> &amp; his Neighbors.</p>
               <p>Theſe extraordinary qualities ſet off with great ſweetneſs and affability, made him be univerſally beloved by all his People. Some called him their <hi>Joſias,</hi> others <hi>Edward the Saint,</hi> and others called him the <hi>Phoenix</hi> that riſe out of his Mothers aſhes; and all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple concluded, that the ſins of <hi>England</hi> muſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170737:278"/>have been very great, ſince they provoked God to deprive the Nation of ſo ſignal a bleſſing, as the reſt of his Reign would have, by all appearance, proved. <hi>Ridley,</hi> and the other good Men of that time, made great lamentations of the Vices, that were grown then ſo common, that Men had paſt all ſhame in them. Luxury, Oppreſſion, and a hatred of Religion had over-run the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rank of People, who gave a countenance to the Reformation, meerly to rob the Church, but by that and their other practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, were become a great ſcandal to ſo good a work. The inferiour ſort were ſo much in the power of the Prieſts, who were ſtill, notwithſtanding their outward Compliance, Papiſts in heart, and were ſo much offended at the ſpoil they ſaw made of all good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, without putting other and more uſeful ones in their room, that they who underſtood little of Religion, laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great prejudices againſt every thing that was advanced by ſuch tools. And theſe things, as they provoked God highly, ſo they diſpoſed the People much to that ſad Cataſtrophe, which is to be the ſubject of the next Book.</p>

Upon that ſhe retired to <hi>Framlingham</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> both to be near the Sea, that ſhe might
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170737:279"/>eſcape to <hi>Flanders,</hi> in caſe of a misfortune; and becauſe the ſlaughter that was made of <hi>Kets</hi> People, by <hi>Northumberland,</hi> begat him the hatred of the People in that Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. Before ſhe got thither, ſhe wrote on the 9th. of <hi>July,</hi> to the Council, and let them know ſhe underſtood, that her Brother was dead, by which ſhe ſucceeded to the Crown, but wondred that ſhe heard not from them; ſhe knew well what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations they had engaged in, but ſhe would pardon all that was done, to ſuch as would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their duty, and proclaim her Title to the Crown. By this it was found, that the Kings death could be no longer kept ſecret; ſo ſome of the Privy Council went to Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> and acknowledged her their <hi>Queen.</hi> The news of the King's death af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted her much, and her being raiſed to the Throne, rather encreaſed, than leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened her trouble. She was a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Perſon, both for Body and Mind. She had learned both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Tongues, to great perfection; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted much in ſtudy. She read <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> and drunk in the Precepts of true Philoſophy ſo early, that as ſhe was not tainted with the levities, not to ſay Vices of thoſe of her Age and condition, ſo ſhe ſeemed to have attained to the practice of the higheſt notions of Philoſophy: for in thoſe ſudden turns of her condition, as ſhe was not exalted with the proſpect of a Crown, ſo ſhe was as little caſt down, when her Palace was made her Priſon.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170737:279"/>The only paſſion ſhe ſhewed, was, that of the Nobleſt kind, in the concern ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt for her Father and Husband, who fell with her, and ſeemingly on her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, though really <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and her Father's weakneſs ruined her. She rejected the offer of the Crown, when it was firſt made her; ſhe ſaid, ſhe knew, that of right it belonged to the late King's Siſters, and ſo ſhe could not with a good Conſcience aſſume it; but it was told her, that both the Judges and Privy Councellours had declared, that it fell to her according to Law. This, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Importunities of her Husband, who had more of his Father's Temper, than of her Philoſophy in him, made her ſubmit to it. Upon this XXI. Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours ſet their hands to a Letter to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> letting her know that Queen <hi>Jane</hi> was now their Soveraign, and that the Marriage between her Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was null, ſo ſhe could not ſucceed to the Crown: and therefore they required her to lay down her Pretenſions, and to ſubmit to the ſettlement now made: and if ſhe gave a ready obedience to theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they promiſed her much favour.</p>
               <p>The day after this they proclaimed <hi>Jane.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">But Lady <hi>Jane Gray</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed.</note> In it they ſet forth, <q rend="inline">That the late King had by Patent excluded his Siſters, that both were illegitimated by ſentences paſt in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parliament, and at beſt they were only his Siſters by the half blood, and ſo

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170737:280"/>Succeſſion from its natural courſe: for ſo <hi>David</hi> preferred <hi>Solomon</hi> to <hi>Adonijah.</hi> In <hi>England,</hi> the Kings claimed the Crown by a long Preſcription, confirmed by many Laws, and not from a divine deſignation: and therefore they inferred, that the Act of Parliament for the Succeſſion ought to take place, and that by vertue of it, the two Siſters ought to ſucceed: and it was ſaid, that as the King could limit the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, ſo he could likewiſe limit the ſucceſſion. It was alſo ſaid, that <hi>Charles Brandon</hi>'s Iſſue by the <hi>French</hi> Queen, was unlawful, becauſe he was then married to one <hi>Mortimer;</hi> yet this was not declared in any Court, and ſo could not take place. Others ſaid, if the Right of blood could not be cut off, why was the <hi>Scotch</hi> Queen cut off? and her being born out of the Kingdom, could not exclude her, as an <hi>Alien,</hi> for though that held in other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet it was only a Proviſion of Law, which could not take away a Divine right, and by ſpecial Law the King's Children were excepted. It was alſo urged, that the Dutcheſs of <hi>Suffolk</hi> ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to her Daughter, who could only claim by her Right: and though <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs, and <hi>Margaret</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Richmond</hi> had not claimed the Crown, but were ſatisfied that their Sons, two <hi>Henries,</hi> the ſecond and ſeventh, ſhould reign in their right, yet it was never heard that a Mother ſhould quit her right to a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: that of the half blood was ſaid to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170737:281"/>be only a rule in Law for private Families, and that it did not extend to the Crown. The power of limiting the ſucceſſion by Patent or Teſtament, was ſaid to be only a Perſonal truſt lodged in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and that it did not deſcend to his Heirs, ſo that King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Patents were thought to be of no force.</p>

Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> (that was his wicked Inſtrument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi>) were all ſent to the <hi>Tower.</hi> Now all People went to implore the Queen's favour, and <hi>Ridley</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, but he was ſent to the <hi>Tower:</hi> for ſhe was both offended with him for his Sermon, and reſolved to put <hi>Bonner</hi> again in the See of <hi>London.</hi> Some of the Judges, and ſeveral Noblemen were alſo ſent thither, among the reſt the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> but three days after he was ſet at liberty. He was a weak Man, and could do little harm, ſo he was pitched on as
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170737:283"/>the firſt Inſtance, towards whom the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhould expreſs her Clemency.</p>
               <p>She came to <hi>London</hi> on the 3d. of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">She comes to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </note> and on the way was met by her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> with a thouſand Horſe, whom ſhe had raiſed to come to the <hi>Queen</hi>'s aſſiſtance. When ſhe came to the <hi>Tower,</hi> ſhe diſcharged the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> of whoſe Commitment mention has been formerly made; as alſo the Lord <hi>Courtney,</hi> Son to the Marqueſs of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who had been kept there ever ſince his Fathers Attainder, whom ſhe made Earl of <hi>Devonſhire.</hi> And thus was ſhe now peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſetled on the Throne; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that great Combination againſt her, which had not been ſo eaſily broken, if the Head of it had not been a Man ſo Univerſally diſtaſtful.</p>
               <p>She was a Lady of great Vertues,
<note place="margin">Her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life.</note> ſhe was ſtrict in her Religion to ſuperſtition; her Temper was much corrupted by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; and the many croſs accidents of her life increaſed this to a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. She adhered ſo reſolutely to her Mothers Intereſts, that it was believed her Father once intended to have taken her Life: upon which her Mother wrote a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Letter to her, charging her to truſt in God, and keep her ſelf pure, and to obey the King in all things, except in matters of Religion: She ſent her two <hi>Latine</hi> Books for her entertainment, Saint <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Epiſtles, and a Book of the Life
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170737:283"/>of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which was perhaps the famous Book of <hi>Thomas à Kempis.</hi> The Kings diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure at her was ſuch, that neither the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> nor <hi>Gardiner,</hi> durſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to intercede for her. <hi>Cranmer</hi> was the only Man that hazarded on it, and did it ſo effectually, that he prevailed with him about it. But after her Mothers death, ſhe hearkned to other Counſels, ſo that upon <hi>Anne Boleyn</hi>'s fall, ſhe made a full ſubmiſſion to him, as was mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. She did alſo in many Letters, which ſhe writ both to her Father, and to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">Proteſt great ſorrow for her former ſtubornneſs, and declared that ſhe put her Soul in his hand, and that her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhould be always directed by him; and being asked what her Opinion was concerning Pilgrimages, Purgatory, and Reliques; ſhe anſwered, that ſhe had no Opinion, but ſuch as ſhe received from the King, who had her whole heart in his keeping: and might imprint upon it, in theſe, and in all other matters, whatever his ineſtimable Vertue, high Wiſdom, and excellent Learning ſhould think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for her.</q> So perfectly had ſhe learned the ſtile, that ſhe knew was moſt acceptable to her Father. After that, ſhe was in all points obedient to him, and during her Brothers Reign, ſhe ſet up on that pretence, that ſhe would adhere to that way of Religion, that was ſetled by her Father.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:170737:284"/>
               <p>Two different Schemes were now ſet before her; <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and all that had complied in the former times, moved, that at firſt ſhe ſhould bring things back to the ſtate in which they were,
<note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels then laid down.</note> when her Father died: and afterwards by eaſie and ſlow ſteps ſhe might again return to the obedience to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> But ſhe her ſelf was more inclined to return to that immediately; ſhe thought ſhe could not be legitimated any other way, and ſo was like to proceed too quick. <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> finding that Political Maximes made no great Impreſſion on her, and that he was lookt on by her as a crafty tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing Man, addreſſed himſelf to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who underſtood Government and Mankind better: and undertook, that if he might have the Seals, he would manage matters ſo, that in a little time he ſhould bring all things about to her mind: and that there was no danger, but in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitating things, and being ſo much go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by <hi>Italian</hi> Counſels: for he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that ſhe had ſent for Cardinal <hi>Pool.</hi> The People had a great Averſion to the Papal authority, and the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were apprehenſive of loſing the <hi>Abbey</hi> Lands; therefore it was neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move theſe prejudices by degrees. He alſo aſſured the Emperour, that he would ſerve all his Intereſts zealouſly, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him how neceſſary it was to ſtop Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Pool,</hi> who ſtood Attainted by Law: In this he was the more earneſt, becauſe
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170737:284"/>he knew <hi>Pool</hi> hated him. The Emperour upon this, writ ſo effectually to the Queen, to depend on <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s Counſels, that on the 13th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he was made Lord Chancellour, and the conduct of affairs was put in his hands. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> being now at liberty, pretended that he was never truly attainted; and that it was no legal Act, that had paſt againſt him, and by this he recovered his Eſtate; all the Grants that had been made out of it, being declared void at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law.</p>
               <p>He was made Lord Steward for the Trial of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlands</hi> Trial,</note> and his Son the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Northampton.</hi> All that they pleaded in their own defence, lay in two points; the one was, whether any thing that was acted by Order of Council, and the authority of the Great Seal, could be Treaſon? The other was, whether thoſe that were as guilty as they were, could ſit and judge them? The Judges anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Great Seal, or Privy Council of one, that was not lawful <hi>Queen,</hi> could give no Authority, nor Indemnity: and that other Peers, if they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by Record, might judge them. Theſe Points being determined againſt them, they pleaded <hi>Guilty,</hi> and ſubmitted to the Queens Mercy: So Sentence paſt upon them: and the day after that, Sir <hi>John Gates,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho. Palmer,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were tried and condemned: But of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170737:285"/>all theſe, it was reſolved, that only <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, Gates</hi> and <hi>Palmer</hi> ſhould ſuffer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heath</hi> was appointed to attend on <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> and to prepare him for death. He then profeſſed he had been always of the old Religion in his heart, and had complied againſt his Conſcience in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, but whether that was true, or whether it was done in hopes of life, as it cannot be certainly known, ſo it ſhews, he had little regard to Religion, either in his life, or at his death. But he was a Man of ſuch a temper, that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to put him out of a capacity of revenging himſelf on his Enemies. On the 22. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he and the other two were beheaded. There paſt ſome expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between <hi>Gates</hi> and him: each of them accuſing the other as the Author of their ruine. But they were ſeemingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and profeſſed they forgave one another. He made a long Speech, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his former ill life, and the Juſtice of the Sentence againſt him; <q rend="inline">He exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the People to ſtand to the Religion of their Anceſtors, to reject all Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to drive the Preachers of them out of the Nation, and declared he had temporiſed againſt his Conſcience, and that he was always of the Religion of his Fore-fathers.</q> He was an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Man, till he was raiſed very high: but that tranſported him out of meaſure, and he was ſo ſtrangely changed in the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170737:285"/>laſt paſſages of his life, that it encreaſed the Jealouſies that were raiſed of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving haſtned King <hi>Edward</hi>'s death: and that the horrors of that Guilt did ſo haunt him, that both the Judgment and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage he had expreſſed in the former parts of his life, ſeemed now to have left him. <hi>Palmer</hi> was little pitied, for he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the betrayer of his former Maſter, the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and was upon that ſervice taken into <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>There was no ſtrict enquiry made into King <hi>Edward</hi>'s death:
<note place="margin">King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> Funeral.</note> all the honour done his Memory, was, that they allowed him Funeral Rites. On the 8th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he was buried at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the Queen had an Exequie, and Maſſes for him at the <hi>Tower. Day</hi> was appointed to preach the Sermon: in it he praiſed the King, but inveighed ſeverely againſt the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of affairs under him. It had been reſolved to bury him according to the old Forms, but <hi>Cranmer</hi> oppoſed that, and prevailed that he ſhould be buried according to the form then ſetled by Law: and he himſelf did officiate, and ended the ſolemnity with a Communion, all which it may be ſuppoſed he did with a very live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow, having both loved the King beyond expreſſion, and looking on his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as the Burial of the Reformation, and as a ſtep to his own.</p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:170737:286"/>
               <p>On the 22. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Queen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in Council, <q rend="inline">That though ſhe was fixed in her own Religion, yet ſhe would not Compel others to it: but would leave that to the motions of God's Spirit, and the labours of good Preachers.</q> The day after that, <hi>Bonner</hi> went to Saint <hi>Pauls;</hi> and <hi>Bourn,</hi> that was his Chaplain, preached; he extolled <hi>Bonner</hi> much, and inveighed againſt the ſufferings he was put to. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this a Tumult was raiſed, for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could not hear reflections made on King <hi>Edward:</hi> ſome flung ſtones at him, and one threw a Dagger at the Pulpit, with ſuch force, that it ſtuck faſt in the wood. <hi>Rogers</hi> and <hi>Bradford</hi> were preſent, who were in great eſteem with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: ſo they ſtood up and quieted them, and conveyed <hi>Bourn</hi> ſafe home. This was a very welcome Accident to the Papiſts, and gave them a colour to prohibit prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, by a Publick Inhibition in the Queen's Name: in which ſhe declared, <q rend="inline">That her Religion was the ſame that it had been from her Infancy, but that ſhe would compel none of her Subjects in matters of Religion; till publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould be taken in it by common Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. She required her People to live quietly, not to uſe the terms of <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or <hi>Heretick,</hi> or other reproachful ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and that none ſhould Preach without Licence: ſhe alſo charged them not to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh any on the account of the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170737:286"/>but as they ſhould be authoriſed by her. She would be ſorry to be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to execute the ſeverity of the Law; but was reſolved not to ſuffer Rebellious doings to go unpuniſhed.</q> This gave great occaſion to cenſure, and was thought a Declaration, not for her Fathers Religion, but for Popery: ſince it was that which ſhe profeſſed from her Infancy. It was alſo obſerved, that ſhe limited her promiſe of not compelling others, till Publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould be taken in it: the meaning of which was, till a Parliament could be brought to concur with her. The reſtraint upon Preaching, without Licence, was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified from what had been done in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time; though then, at firſt, all might preach in their own Churches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; It was only neceſſary, if they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched any where elſe: Biſhops had alſo the power of Licenſing in their Dioceſes: and the total reſtraint that followed afterwards, laſted but a ſhort while. But now all the Pulpits were put under an Interdict, till the Preachers ſhould obtain a Licence from <hi>Gardiner:</hi> and that he reſolved to grant to none, but thoſe that would Preach as he ſhould direct them. The Queen's threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to proceed againſt ſuch as were guilty of the late Rebellion, ſtruck a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terrour in the City of <hi>London;</hi> for the greateſt part had been in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure concerned in it.</p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:170737:287"/>
               <p>In <hi>Suffolk</hi> the people thought their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and the Queens promiſes gave them a Title to own their Religion more avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly:
<note place="margin">Severe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the men of <hi>Saffolk,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> But orders were ſent to the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> to execute the Queens Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to ſee that none ſhould preach that had not obtained a Licence. Upon this, ſome of thoſe that had merited moſt, came and put the Queen in mind of her Promiſe: But ſhe ſent them home with a cold Anſwer; and told them, they muſt learn to obey her, and not pretend to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern her: And one that had ſpoken more confidently than the reſt, was ſet in a Pillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for it three days, as having ſaid words that tended to defame the Queen. This was a ſad Omen of a ſevere Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which the claiming of Promiſes went for a crime. <hi>Bradford</hi> and <hi>Rogers</hi> were alſo ſeized on; and it was pretended, that the authority they ſhewed in quieting the Tumult, was a ſign that they had raiſed it. <hi>Gardiner, Bonner, Tonſtal, Heath</hi> and <hi>Day,</hi> were reſtored to their Biſhopricks; they had all Appealed to the King before Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence had paſt againſt them; ſo Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were given to ſome Civilians to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the grounds of theſe Appeals, and they made report that they were good, and ſo that the Sentences againſt them were null. <hi>Gardiner</hi> had authority given him to grant Prieſts Licences to preach in any Church, as he ſhould appoint: By this the Reformed were not only ſilenced, but their Churches and Pulpits were caſt open
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170737:287"/>to ſuch as <hi>Gardiner</hi> pleaſed to ſend among them. They differed in their opinions how far they were bound to obey this Prohibition: Some thought they might forbear publick Preaching, when they were ſo required: But they made that up by private Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and Inſtructions: Others thought that if this had been only a particular hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip upon a few, the regard to Peace and Order ſhould have obliged them to ſubmit to it; but ſince it was general, and done on deſign to extinguiſh the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that they ought to go on, and preach at their peril; of this laſt ſort ſeveral were put in Priſon for their diſobedience, and among others <hi>Hooper</hi> and <hi>Coverdale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The people that loved the old Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, began now to ſet up Images, and the old Rites again in many places: And though this was plainly againſt Law, yet the Government encouraged it all they could.
<note place="margin">Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt Judge <hi>Hales.</hi>
                  </note> Judge <hi>Hales</hi> thought his refuſing to concur with the reſt in excluding the Queen, gave him a more than ordinary priviledge. So when he went the Circuit, he gave the charge in <hi>Kent,</hi> requiring the Juſtices to ſee to the execution of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws, that continued ſtill in force. But upon his return he was committed for this, and removed from Priſon to Priſon; which, with the threatnings that were made him, terrified him ſo much, that he cut his Throat, but not mortally: As he recovered he made his ſubmiſſion, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his liberty. Yet the diſorder he
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170737:288"/>was in, never left him till he drowned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This ſhewed that former merit was not ſo much confidered as a readineſs to comply in matters of Religion; Judge <hi>Bromley,</hi> though he made no difficulty in declaring his opinion for the Queens exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet ſince he profeſt himſelf a Papiſt, was made Lord Chief Juſtice: and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> who had proceeded in it with great averſion, yet becauſe he was for the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, was put in Priſon, and ſeverely Fined; though he had this merit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that he had ſent his Son and twenty men with him, to declare for the Queen; and had this alſo to recommend him to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he had ſix Sons, and ten Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> was forced to retire from <hi>Oxford:</hi> He came to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> but was not like to find long ſhelter there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cranmer</hi> kept himſelf quiet for ſome time,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cranmers</hi> Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> which gave the other party occaſion to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh that he was reſolved to turn with the Tyde. <hi>Bonner</hi> writ upon that to a friend of his, that Mr. <hi>Canterbury</hi> (ſo he called him in deriſion) was become very humble; but that would not ſerve his turn, for he would be ſent to the <hi>Tower</hi> within a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while. Some adviſed him to fly beyond Sea; he anſwered, That though he could not diſſwade others to fly from the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they ſaw coming on, yet that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming a man in his ſtation, that had ſuch a hand in the changes formerly made. He prepared a Writing, which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have publiſhed: The ſubſtance of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170737:288"/>it was, <q rend="inline">That he found the Devil was more than ordinary buſie in defaming the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God; and that whereas the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the Maſs had been caſt out, and that the Lords Supper was again ſet up, according to its firſt Inſtitution; the Devil now, to promote the Maſs, which was his invention, ſet his Inſtruments on work, who gave it out, that it was now ſaid in <hi>Canterbury</hi> by his order: Therefore he proteſted that was falſe, and that a diſſembling Monk (this was <hi>Thornton</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Suffragan of <hi>Dover</hi>) had done it without his knowledge. He alſo offered that he and <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> with ſuch other four or five as he ſhould name, would be ready to prove the errours of the Maſs, and to defend the whole Doctrine and Service ſet forth by the late King, as moſt conform to the word of God, and to the practice of the Ancient Church for many Ages.</q> Before he had finiſhed this, <hi>Scory,</hi> that had been Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> coming to him, he ſhewed it him and deſired his opinion in it. He being a hot man, liked it ſo well, that he gave Copies of it: and one of theſe was read publickly in <hi>Cheapſide.</hi> So three days after that he was cited to the <hi>Star</hi>-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to anſwer for it: he confeſſed it was his, and that he had intended to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged it in ſome things, and to have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed it with his Hand and Seal to it, at Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> and many other Churches. He was at this time diſmiſt: <hi>Gardiner</hi> ſaw the Queen intended to put Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170737:289"/>his room, and that made him endeavour to preſerve him. Some moved that a ſmall Penſion might be aſſigned him, and that he ſhould be ſuffered to live private: for the ſweetneſs of his Temper had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him ſo Univerſal a love from all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that it was thought too hardy a ſtep to proceed to extremities with him. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſaid, he had been the chief Author of all the Hereſie that was in the Nation, and that it was not decent for the Queen to ſhew any favour to him, that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Sentence of her Mothers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce. Within a Week after this, both <hi>Latimer</hi> and he, and ſeveral other Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers were put in Priſon.</p>
               <p>

                  </note> had leave given him to go beyond Sea: ſo had alſo <hi>à Laſco,</hi> and the <hi>Germans:</hi> and about two hundred of them went away in <hi>December:</hi> but both in <hi>Denmark,</hi> where they firſt landed, and in <hi>Lubeck, Wiſmar</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> to which they removed, they were denied admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; becauſe they were of the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Confeſſion, and in all theſe places the fierce <hi>Lutherans</hi> prevailed; who did ſo far put off all bowels, that they would not ſo much as ſuffer theſe Refuges to ſtay among them, till the rigours of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were over: but at laſt they found ſhelter in <hi>Friſeland.</hi> Many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> foreſeeing the ſtorm, reſolved to withdraw in time: ſo the ſtrangers being required
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170737:289"/>to be gone, they went under that Cover in great numbers. But the Council un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that about a thouſand had ſo conveyed themſelves away, gave order that none ſhould be ſuffered to go as ſtrangers, but thoſe that had a Certificate from the Ambaſſadour of the Princes, to whom they belonged. With thoſe that fled beyond Sea, divers Eminent Preachers went: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom were <hi>Cox, Sandys, Grindall,</hi> and <hi>Horn,</hi> all afterwards highly advanced by Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things began to alienate the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the Government,

                  </note> therefore on the other hand great care was taken to ſweeten them. The Queen beſtowed the chief Offices of the Houſhold on thoſe that had aſſiſted her in her extremity; there being no way more effectual to engage all to adhere to the Crown, than the grateful acknowledgment of paſt ſervices. An unuſual honour was done to <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> Earl of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> he had a Licence granted him under the Great Seal, to cover his Head in her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.

There was a General Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don proclaimed, and with that, <q rend="inline">the Queen diſcharged the Subjects of the two Tenths, two Fifteenths, and a Subſidy that had been granted by the laſt Parliament: and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170737:290"/>ſhe alſo declared that ſhe would pay both her Fathers Debts and her Brothers; and though her Treaſure was much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, yet ſhe eſteeming the love of her People her beſt Treaſure, forgave thoſe Taxes, in lieu of which ſhe deſired only the hearts of her Subjects, and that they would ſerve God ſincerely, and pray earneſtly for her.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On the 20th.
<note place="margin">A Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meets, and repeals ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Laws.</note> of <hi>October,</hi> a Parliament met. There had been great violences uſed in many Elections, and many falſe Returns were made: ſome that were known to be zealous for the Reformation were forcibly turned out of the Houſe of Commons; which was afterwards offered as a ground upon which that Parliament, and all Acts made in it, might have been annulled: There came only two of the Reformed Biſhops to the Houſe of Lords: The two Arch-biſhops, and three Biſhops were in Priſon: Two others were turned out, the reſt ſtayed at home, ſo only <hi>Taylor</hi> and <hi>Harley,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Lincoln</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> came. When Maſs began to be ſaid, they went out, as ſome report it, but were never ſuffered to come to their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces again: others ſay, they refuſed to joyn in that Worſhip, and ſo were violently thruſt out. In the Houſe of Commons, ſome of the more forward moved, that King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws might be reviewed, but things were not ripe enough for that. <hi>Nowell</hi> a Prebendary of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> was
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170737:290"/>returned Burgeſs for a Town; but the Houſe voted, That the Clergy being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the lower Houſe of Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, could not be admitted to ſit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Laity. The Commons ſent up a Bill of Tonnage and Poundage, which the Lords ſent down amended in two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo's, and the Commons did not then inſiſt on their Priviledge, that the Lords could not alter a Bill of Money. The only publick Bill that was finiſhed this Seſſion, was a Repeal of all late Statutes, making any Crime, Treaſon, that was not ſo by the 25. of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; or Felony, that was not ſo before King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth: excepting from the benefit of this Act, all that were put in Priſon before the end of <hi>September</hi> laſt, who were alſo excepted out of the General Pardon. The Marchioneſs of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> her Son, were reſtored in blood by two private Acts: and then the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament was prorogued for three days, that it might be ſaid, the firſt Seſſion under the <hi>Queen,</hi> was meerly for Acts of Mercy.</p>
               <p>At their next Meeting,
<note place="margin">The Qu.'s Mother's marriage confirm'd.</note> after the Bill of Tonnage and Poundage was paſt: a Bill paſt through both Houſes in Four days, repealing the Divorce of the <hi>Queens</hi> Mother: <q rend="inline">In which they declared the Marriage to have been lawful; and that malicious Perſons had poſſeſſed the King with ſcruples concerning it; and had by Corruption procured the Seals of Foreign
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170737:291"/>Univerſities condemning it, and had by threatnings and ſiniſtrous Arts obtained the like in <hi>England:</hi> Upon which <hi>Cranmer</hi> had pronounced the Sentence of Divorce, which had been confirmed in Parliament: They therefore looking on the miſeries that had fallen on the Nation, ſince that time, as Judgments from God for that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, condemn it, and repeal the Acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming it.</q> 
                  <hi>Gardiner,</hi> in this, performed his promiſe to the Queen, of getting her to be declared Legitimate, without taking notice of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s authority: but he ſhewed that he was paſt ſhame, when he procured ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of a Sentence, which he had ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilely promoted: and he particularly knew the falſhood of this pretence, that the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Univerſities were corrupted. He had alſo ſet it on long before <hi>Cranmer</hi> engaged in it, and ſat in Court with him, when it was pronounced. By this Act the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was upon the matter again illegitimated, ſince the ground upon which her Mothers marriage ſubſiſted, was the Divorce of the firſt Marriage: and it was either upon this pretence, or on old ſcores, that the Queen, who had hitherto treated her as a Siſter, began now to uſe her more ſeverely. Others ſuggeſt that a ſecret ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry was the true ſpring of it. It was thought the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> was much in the Queens favour, but he either not preſuming ſo high, or liking Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> better, who was both more beautiful, and was XIX. Years younger than the Queen,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170737:291"/>made his addreſſes to her, which provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Queen ſo much, that it drew a great deal of trouble on them both.</p>
               <p>The next Bill was a Repeal of all the Laws, made in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s reign,
<note place="margin">King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion: it was argued ſix days in the Houſe of Commons, and carried without a Diviſion: by this, Religion was again put back into the ſtate, in which King <hi>Henry</hi> had left it: and this was to take place after the 20th. of <hi>December</hi> next, but till then it was left free to all, either to uſe the old, or the new Service, as they pleaſed. Another Act paſt againſt all, that ſhould diſquiet any Preacher for his Sermons, or interrupt Divine Offices, either ſuch as had been in the laſt year of King <hi>Henry,</hi> or ſuch as the Queen ſhould ſet out: by which ſhe was empowered to reſtore the ſervice in all things, as it had been, before her Father made the breach with <hi>Rome:</hi> Offenders were either to be puniſhed by Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, or by an Impriſonment for three Months. And the Houſe of Commons was now ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that they ſent up a Bill, for the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of all ſuch as would not come to Church or Sacraments, after the Old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhould be again ſet up: yet the Lords fearing this might alarm the Nation too much, let it fall. Another Law was made, that if any, to the number of Twelve, ſhould meet to alter any thing in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or for any Riot, or ſhould by any
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170737:292"/>publick notice, ſuch as Bells or Beacons, gather the People together, and upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation made, ſhould not diſperſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they, and all that aſſiſted them, were declared guilty of Felony: and if any more than two, met for theſe ends, they ſhould lye a Year in Priſon; and all People were required, under ſevere Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to aſſiſt the Juſtices, for repreſſing ſuch Aſſemblies. So the favour of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Act of Repeal, appeared to be a mockery, when ſo ſoon after it, ſo ſevere a Law made: by which diſorders, that might ariſe upon ſudden heats, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be Felonies. The Marqueſs of <hi>Northampton</hi>'s ſecond Marriage was alſo annulled, but no Declaration was made againſt Divorces in general, grounded on the Indiſſolubleneſs of the Marriage bond; only that particular ſentence was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as pronounced upon falſe ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>An Act alſo paſſed,
<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Norfolks</hi> Attainder repealed.</note> annulling the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk:</hi> thoſe who had purchaſed ſome parts of his Eſtate from the Crown, oppoſed it much in the Houſe of Commons: but the Duke came down to the Houſe, and deſired them earneſtly to paſs it, and aſſured them, that he would refer all differences between him and the Patentees, either to Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or to the Queen: and ſo it was agreed to <q rend="inline">It ſet forth the pretences, that were made uſe of to Attaint him; as that he uſed Coats of Arms, which
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170737:292"/>he and his Anceſtors had lawfully uſed. There was a Commiſſion given to ſome, to declare the Royal aſſent to it; but that was not ſigned, but only ſtamped by the King's mark: and that not at the upper end, as was uſual, but beneath; nor did it appear, that the Royal Aſſent was ever given to it, and they declared, that in all time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Royal aſſent ſhould be given, either by the King in Perſon, or by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion under the Great Seal; ſigned by the King's hand, and publickly declared to both Houſes.</q> 
                  <hi>Cranmer, Guilford Dudley,</hi> and his Wife the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> and two of his Brothers were tryed for Treaſon; they all confeſſed their Indictments: only <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> appealed to the Judges, who knew how unwillingly he had conſented to the Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Queen, and that he did it not, till they, whoſe profeſſion it was to know the Law, had ſigned it. They were all At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of Treaſon, for levying War againſt the Queen, and their Attainders were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in Parliament; ſo was <hi>Cranmer</hi> le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally diveſted of his Archbiſhoprick; but ſince he was put in it by the <hi>Pope</hi>'s authority, it was reſolved to degrade him by the forms of the Canon-Law: and the <hi>Queen</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to pardon his Treaſon, that it might appear ſhe did not act upon revenge, but Zeal: ſhe was often prevailed with, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Injuries againſt her ſelf, but was always inexorable in matters of Religion.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:170737:293"/>
               <p>But now her Treaty with the Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to take vent, which put the Parliament in ſome diſorder. When ſhe came firſt to the Crown,
<note place="margin">A Treaty for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> to the Pope:</note> the Popes Legate at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> ſent over <hi>Commendone,</hi> to ſee if he could ſpeak with her, and to perſwade her to reconcile her Kingdom to the Apoſtolick See. The management of the matter was left to his diſcretion, for the Legate would not truſt this ſecret to <hi>Gardiner,</hi> nor any of the other Biſhops. <hi>Commendone</hi> came over in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of a Merchant, and by accident met with one of the Queens Servants, who had lived ſome years beyond Sea, and was known to him, and by his means he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red acceſs to the Queen. She aſſured him of her firm reſolution to return to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of that See, but charged him to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the matter with great prudence; for if it were too early diſcovered, it might diſturb her affairs, and obſtruct the deſign: By him ſhe wrote both to the Pope, and to Cardinal <hi>Pool;</hi> and inſtructed <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi> in order to the ſending over <hi>Pool</hi> with a Legatine power: She alſo asked him, whether the Pope might not diſpence with <hi>Pool</hi> to marry, ſince he was only in Deacons Orders. This was a welcome Meſſage to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and proved the foundation of <hi>Commendone</hi>'s advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There was a publick rejoicing for three days, and the Pope ſaid Maſs himſelf upon it; and gave a largeſs of Indulgences, in which he might be the more liberal, becauſe they were like to come into credit
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170737:293"/>again, and to go off at the old rates. Yet all that <hi>Commendone</hi> ſaid in the Conſiſtory, was, That he underſtood from good hands, that the Queen was well diſpoſed to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union. Some of the ſtiffer Cardinals thought it was below the Popes dignity to ſend a Legate, till an Embaſſie ſhould come firſt from the Queen, deſiring it: Yet the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret was ſo whiſpered among them, that it was generally known. It was ſaid, they ought to imitate the Shepherd in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who went to ſeek the ſtray Sheep: And therefore <hi>Pool</hi> was appointed to go Legate, with ample powers. <hi>Gardiner</hi> was in fear of him, and ſo adviſed the Emperour to ſtop him in his journey; and to touch the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in a tender part, it is ſaid that he let him know that the Queen had ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations for the Cardinal.
<note place="margin">And for a Match with the Prince of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note> The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had now propoſed a Match with her for his Son, though he was nine years young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ſhe was; yet ſhe being but thirty ſeven, there was reaſon enough to hope for Children; and the uniting <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy ſeem'd to be all that was wanting to ſtrengthen it on all hands, ſo as to ruine the <hi>French</hi> Kingdom. The Queen ſaw reaſons enough to determine her to entertain it: She found it would be hard to bring the Nation about in matters of Religion, without the aſſiſtance of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power: Yet it is more reaſonable to think that <hi>Gardiner,</hi> who was always governed by his Intereſts, would have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promoted the match with <hi>Pool,</hi> for
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170737:294"/>then he had been Infallibly made Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and had got <hi>Pool</hi>'s Hat; and the Government would have been much eaſier, if the Queen had married a Subject, than it could be under a Stranger, eſpecially one whoſe greatneſs made all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple very apprehenſive of him.</p>
               <p>The reſtoring the Papal power,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pool</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to the Queen.</note> and the Match with the Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> were things of ſuch uneaſie digeſtion, that it was not fit to adventure on both at once; therefore the Emperour preſt the Queen to begin with her Marriage, and by that ſhe would be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully aſſiſted to carry on her other deſigns; and at laſt the Queen her ſelf was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſend to <hi>Pool,</hi> to adviſe him to ſtop his Journey for ſome time. She ſent over the Acts of this Parliament, to let him ſee what progreſs ſhe was making, and to aſſure him ſhe would make all convenient haſte in the Re-union: But the Parliament had expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo great an averſion to the reſtoring the Popes power, and were ſo apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of loſing the Abbey-Lands, that it would prejudice her affairs much, if he ſhould come over before the peoples minds were better prepared. She alſo deſired him to ſend her a Liſt of thoſe that were fit to be made Biſhops, in the room of thoſe that were turned out. To this he writ a long and tedious anſwer; he rejoiced at the Acts that were paſſed, but obſerved great defects in them: In that concerning her Mothers Marriage, there was no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the Popes Bull of Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170737:294"/>by which only it could be a lawful Marriage. The other for ſetting up the Worſhip, as it was in the end of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reign, he cenſured more; for they were then in a ſtate of Schiſm, and ſo this eſtabliſhed Schiſm by a Law: And he ſaid, that while the Interdict lay on the Nation, it was a ſin to perform Divine Offices. He had been very frankly diſpatched by the Pope and the Conſiſtory, with many favourable Inſtructions; but if theſe were ſo deſpiſed, and he ſtill ſtopt, it might provoke him to recal his power. He knew all this flowed from the Emperour, who would perhaps adviſe her to follow ſuch Political Maximes as himſelf was governed by, but his ill ſucceſs in the buſineſs of the <hi>Interim,</hi> might well frighten others from following ſuch Counſels: And he was afraid that Carnal Policy might govern her too much, and that ſo ſhe would fall from her ſimplicity in Chriſt. He deſired her to take Courage, and to depend on God; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her to go her ſelf to the Parliament, having before-hand prepared ſome to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond her, and to tell them that ſhe was touched in Conſcience with a ſenſe of the ſin of Schiſm, and that therefore ſhe deſired the Act of Attainder that ſtood againſt him might be Repealed, and that he might be invited to come over, and reconcile them to the Apoſtolick See: And ſhe might aſſure them that all neceſſary caution ſhould be uſed to prevent the Nations being brought under a thraldome to the Papacy.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170737:295"/>But the Queen was now poſſeſt with <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner</hi>'s Counſels, and look'd on <hi>Pool</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices as more candid than prudent. <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> perſwaded her that though he was a good and learned man, yet he underſtood not the preſent genius of the Nation; and <hi>Pool</hi> lookt on <hi>Gardiner</hi> as a man of no Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that he was more converſant in Intrigues of State, than touched with any ſenſe of Religion: But the Emperour was convinced that <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s Methods were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and preferred them to <hi>Pool</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>When the Treaty of the Queens Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age came to be known,
<note place="margin">The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament oppoſes the match, and is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</note> the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons was much alarmed at it; and they ſent their Speaker with twenty of their Members, with an Addreſs to her, not to marry a ſtranger: And they were ſo infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that the Court judged it neceſſary to diſſolve the Parliament. <hi>Gardiner</hi> upon this, let the Emperour know that the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies which were taken up on the account of the Match were ſuch, that except very extraordinary conditions were offered, it would occaſion a general Rebellion. He alſo writ to him that great ſums muſt be ſent over both to gratifie the Nobility, and to enable them to carry the Elections to the next Parliament, in oppoſition to ſuch as would ſtand againſt them. As for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, it was reſolved to grant any that ſhould be demanded; for the Emperour reckoned that if his Son were once married to her, it would be eaſie for him to govern the Councils as he pleaſed: And for Money
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170737:295"/>there was 400000 pound ordered to be divided up and down the Nation, at the diſcretion of <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and the Emperours Ambaſſadours: A great part of it was pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in hand, and the reſt was brought over with the Prince. This the Emperour bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from ſome of the Free Towns of <hi>Germany;</hi> and when they were preſſing him for the re-payment of it about a year after; he for his excuſe told them the charge he had been at for his Sons Marriage, but that he hoped to be re-imburſed from <hi>England;</hi> which was thus bought and ſold by a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Biſhop and a corrupted Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. <hi>Gardiner</hi> did alſo make uſe of his power, as Chancellour, to force all people to comply with him; for there was no favour nor common Juſtice ſhewed in his Court of Chancery to any others.</p>
               <p>With the Parliament a Convocation met, <hi>Harpsfield</hi> preached to them,
<note place="margin">A Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation meets, and diſputes about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Queen, and the Biſhops that had been deprived in the late times, with a zeal that ſhewed how fervently he aſpired to preferment: He inveighed againſt the late times with great ſharpneſs; ſo that his Sermon was divided between Satyr and Panegyrick. Six of the Reformed Divines were qualified by their dignities to ſit in the lower Houſe, being either Deans or Arch-Deacons, Deacons, who were <hi>Philpot, Philips, Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Cheyney, Ailmer</hi> and <hi>Young.</hi> They made a vigorous oppoſition to a motion that was propoſed for condemning the Catechiſm and Common-Prayer-Book that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170737:296"/>had been ſet out in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, and particularly the Articles againſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation: To this all agreed except thoſe ſix. It was pretended that the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm was not ſet out by authority of Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: To which <hi>Philpot</hi> anſwered, That the Convocation had deputed ſome to compoſe it, and ſo it was on the matter, their work. A diſputation was propoſed concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, though all the reſt of the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſubſcribed the Concluſion firſt; which was complained of as a prepoſterous method. The ſix deſired that <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Rogers,</hi> with ſome others, might be ſuffered to come and join with them; but that was refuſed, ſince they were no members, and were then in Priſon.</p>
               <p>On the twenty third of <hi>October</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute began, many of the Nobility, and others, being preſent; <hi>Weſton</hi> was Prolocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, he opened it with a Proteſtation, that they went not to diſpute, as calling the Truth in queſtion, but only to ſatisfie the objections of a few. <hi>Haddon, Ailmer</hi> and <hi>Young,</hi> foreſaw that it was reſolved to run them down with numbers &amp; noiſe, ſo at firſt they refuſed to diſpute, and the laſt of them went away. <hi>Cheyney</hi> argued from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s calling the Sacrament <hi>Bread, Origen</hi>'s ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it nouriſhed the Body, and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi>'s ſaying that <hi>the Elements did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from their former ſubſtance, form, and ſhape. Moreman</hi> anſwered, that <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s words were to be underſtood of an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental ſubſtance: It was replied, that <hi>form</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:170737:296"/>and <hi>ſhape</hi> belonged to the accidents, but <hi>ſubſtance</hi> belonged to the nature of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Philpot</hi> ſhewed that the occaſion of his uſing theſe words was to prove againſt the <hi>Entychians,</hi> that there was a true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature in Chriſt, notwithſtanding its union with the Godhead; which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by this ſimile, that the Elements in the Euchariſt remained in their nature; ſo this muſt be underſtood of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine: But to this no anſwer was made; and when he ſeemed to preſs it too far, he was commanded to be ſilent. <hi>Haddon</hi> cited many paſſages out of the Fathers, to ſhew that they believed Chriſt was ſtill in Heaven, and that the Sacrament was a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of him till his ſecond coming: He alſo asked, whether they thought that Chriſt did eat his own natural Body; and when that was confeſſed, he ſaid it was needleſs to diſpute with men who could ſwallow down ſuch an abſurdity. The diſputation conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſeveral days: <hi>Philpot</hi> made a long Speech againſt the Corporal preſence, but was oft interrupted; for they told him that he might propoſe an Argument, but they would not hear him make Harangues. He undertook to prove before the Queen and her Council, that the Maſs, as they had it, was no Sacrament at all, and that the body of Chriſt was not preſent in it; and if he failed in it, he would be content to be burnt at the Court Gate. After ſome ſhort time ſpent in citing paſſages out of the Fathers, <hi>Philpot</hi> was commanded to hold his peace,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170737:297"/>otherwiſe they would ſend him to Priſon: He claimed the priviledge of the Houſe for freedome of Speech, but being much cried down, he ſaid they were a company of men who had diſſembled with God and the World in the late Reign, and were now met together to ſet forth falſe devices, which they were not able to maintain. <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s words were much and often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on; ſo <hi>Weſton</hi> anſwered, if <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſhould be yielded to them, they had an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Fathers on the other ſide. <hi>Cheyney</hi> ſhewed out of <hi>Heſychius,</hi> that the cuſtome of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was to burn ſo much of the Elements as was not conſumed: And he asked what it was that was burnt: One anſwered, it was either the Body of Chriſt, or the ſubſtance of Bread put there by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; at which he ſmiled, and ſaid a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply was needleſs. When much diſcourſe had paſt, <hi>Weſton</hi> asked if the Houſe were not fully ſatisfied, to which the Clergy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Yes;</hi> but the Spectators cried out <hi>No, No;</hi> for the doors were opened: then <hi>Weſton</hi> asked the five Diſputants if they would anſwer the Arguments that ſhould be put to them? <hi>Ailmer</hi> ſaid, they would not enter into ſuch a Diſputation, where matters were ſo indecently carried: They propoſed only the Reaſons why they could not joyn with the Vote that had been put concerning the Sacrament, but unleſs they had fairer Judges, they would go no further. <hi>Weſton</hi> broke up all by ſaying, <hi>You have the Word, but we have the Sword;</hi> rightly point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170737:297"/>out that wherein the ſtrength of both fides conſiſted. It is not to be doubted but that the Popiſh party pretended they had the Victory, for that always the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſide does upon ſuch occaſions: Yet it was viſible that this diſpute was not ſo fairly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, as thoſe were in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days; in which for near a year before any change was made, there were publick diſputes in the Univerſities; which were more proper places for them, than a Town full of noiſe and buſineſs. The queſtion was alſo here determined firſt, and then diſputed: And the preſence and favour of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil did as much raiſe the one party, as it depreſſed the other. In the end of this year <hi>Veyſey</hi> was again repoſſeſſed of the See of <hi>Exeter, Coverdale</hi> being now a Priſoner in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the beginning of the next year,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1554"/> a great Embaſſy came from the Emperour,
<note place="margin">The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,</note> to agree the conditions of the Marriage between his Son and the Queen. <hi>Gardiner</hi> took care to have extraordinary ones granted, both to induce the Parliament more eaſily to conſent to it, and to keep the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from being admitted to any ſhare in the Government, that ſo he might keep it in his own hands: But the Emperour was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to grant every thing that ſhould be asked. It was agreed that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be entirely in the Queen, and that though Pr. <hi>Philip</hi> was to be named in all Writs, and his Image was to be on the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170737:298"/>Coin and Seals, yet the Queens hand alone was to give authority to every thing, without his: No <hi>Spaniard</hi> was to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any Office: No change was to be made in the Law, nor was the Queen to be required to go out of <hi>England</hi> againſt her will: Nor might their iſſue go out of <hi>England</hi> but by the conſent of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Queen was to have of Jointure 40000 <hi>l.</hi> out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and 20000 <hi>l.</hi> out of the <hi>Netherlands:</hi> If the Queen had a Son, he was to inherit <hi>Burgundy</hi> and the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> as well as <hi>England;</hi> if Daughters only, they were to ſucceed to her Crowns, and to have ſuch portions from <hi>Spain,</hi> as was ordinary to be given to Kings Daughters: The Prince was to have no ſhare in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment after her death: And the Queen might keep up her League with <hi>France,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Match.</p>
               <p>But this did not ſatisfie the Nation,
<note place="margin">Which provokes ſome to rebel.</note> which lookt on theſe offers only as baits to hook them into ſlavery. The ſeverities of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Government in all the Provinces that were united to that Crown, and the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Cruelties exerciſed in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> were much talkt of, and it was ſaid <hi>England</hi> muſt now preſerve it ſelf, or be for ever infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>Carew</hi> and <hi>Wiat</hi> undertook to raiſe the Countrey, the one in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and the other in <hi>Kent,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to raiſe the Midland Counties: for the diſpoſition to riſe was general, and might have been fatal to the Queen, if there had been good heads to have led the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170737:298"/>people. But before it grew ripe, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was diſcovered, and upon that Sir <hi>Peter Carew</hi> fled to <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wiat</hi> gathered ſome men about him,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wiat</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</note> and on the twenty fifth of <hi>January</hi> he made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation at <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> that he intended nothing but to preſerve the Nation from the yoke of ſtrangers; and aſſured the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that all <hi>England</hi> would riſe. The Sheriff of <hi>Kent</hi> required him, under pain of Treaſon, to diſperſe his Company, but he did not obey his Summons: One <hi>Knevet</hi> raiſed a body of men about <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, but was intercepted and rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a force commanded by the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who was ſent with two hundred Horſe, and ſix hundred <hi>Londoners</hi> to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate this Inſurrection; but ſome that came over from <hi>Wiat</hi> as deſerters perſwaded the <hi>Londoners</hi> that it was a common cauſe, in which they were engaged, to maintain the liberty of the Nation: So they all went over to <hi>Wiat.</hi> Upon this, the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> retired back to <hi>London;</hi> and <hi>Wiat,</hi> who had kept himſelf under the defence of <hi>Rocheſter</hi>-Bridge, advanced towards it. The Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> made a faint attempt to raiſe the Country, but it did not ſucceed, and he was taken and brought to the <hi>Tower.</hi> The Queen ſent the offer of a Pardon to <hi>Wiat</hi> and his men; but that not being received by them, ſhe ſent ſome of her Council to treat with him. He was blown up with his ſmall ſucceſs, and moved that the Queen would come to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170737:299"/>put the command of it into his hands, till a new Council were ſetled about her: So it appeared there was no Treaty to be thought on. The Queen went into <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and made great proteſtations of her love to her people, and that ſhe would not diſpoſe of herſelf in Marriage, but for the good of the Nation. <hi>Wiat</hi> was now four thouſand ſtrong, and came to <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> but could not force the Bridge of <hi>London:</hi> He was informed the City would all riſe, if he ſhould come to their aid; but he could not find Boats for paſſing over to <hi>Eſſex,</hi> ſo he was forced to go to the Bridge of <hi>Kingſton.</hi> On the fourth of <hi>February</hi> he came thither, but found it cut; yet his men mended it, and he got to <hi>Hide Park</hi> next morning. His men were weary and diſheartned, and now not above 500; ſo that though the Queens forces could have eaſily diſperſed them, yet they let them go forward, that they might caſt themſelves into their hands: He marched through the <hi>Strand,</hi> and got to <hi>Ludgate,</hi> where he hoped to have found the Gate opened; but being diſappointed, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back, and was forſaken by his men, ſo that a Herauld without uſing any force, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended him at <hi>Temple-bar.</hi> It was on <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday,</hi> and the Queen had ſhewed ſuch Courage that ſhe would not ſtir from <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> nor would ſhe omit the Devotions of that day; and this ſucceſs was looked on as a reward from Heaven on her Piety. This raw and ill formed Rebellion was as
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170737:299"/>lucky for the ends of the Court, as if <hi>Gardiner</hi> had projected it; for in a weak Government an ill digeſted Inſurrection raiſes the power of the Prince, and adds as much Spirit to his Friends, as it depreſſes the faction againſt him; and it alſo gives a handle to do ſome things for which it were not eaſie otherwiſe to find either Colours or Inſtruments. The Popiſh Authors ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to caſt the blame of this on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Preachers: but did not name any one of them, that was in it; ſo it appears, that what ſome later Writers have ſaid of <hi>Poinet</hi>'s having been in it, is falſe; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his name had certainly been put in the number of thoſe, that were Attainted for it.</p>
               <p>Upon this it was reſolved to proceed againſt Lady <hi>Jane Gray,</hi> and her Husband;
<note place="margin">Lady <hi>Jane Grays</hi> Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> ſhe had lived ſix Months in the daily Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations of Death, ſo ſhe was not much ſurpriſed at it: <hi>Fecknam,</hi> who was ſent to prepare her for Death, acknowledged that he was aſtoniſhed at her calm behaviour, her great knowledge, and the extraordinary ſence ſhe had of Religion. She writ to her Father, to moderate his grief for her death, ſince it was great matter of joy to her, that ſhe was ſo near an end of her Miſeries, and the enjoyment of Eternal glory. One <hi>Harding,</hi> that had been her Fathers Chaplain, and a zealous Preacher in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, had now changed his Religion: to him ſhe wrote a long and pathetick Letter, ſetting forth his Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170737:300"/>and the Judgments of God, which he might expect upon it. She ſent her <hi>Greek</hi> New Teſtament to her Siſter, with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>Greek,</hi> recommending the ſtudy of that Book to her, and chiefly the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in her practice: theſe were the laſt exerciſes of this rare young Perſon. She was at firſt much moved, when ſhe ſaw her Husband led out to his Execution, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her ſelf, when ſhe conſidered how ſoon ſhe was to follow him: and when he deſired they might take leave of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe declined it; for ſhe thought it would encreaſe their Grief, and diſorder: and continued ſo ſetled in her temper, that ſhe ſaw his beheaded Body carried to the Chappel in the <hi>Tower,</hi> without expreſſing any viſible concern about it. She was carried out next to a Scaffold ſet up within the <hi>Tower,</hi> to hinder great Crouds from looking on a ſight, which was like to raiſe much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in the Spectators. She confeſſed her ſin, in taking an honour that was due to another, though it was a thing neither procured nor deſired by her; and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her other ſins againſt God, that ſhe had loved her ſelf, and the World too much; and thanked God for making her afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a means to her repentance: ſhe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe died a true Chriſtian, truſting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Merits of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> then ſhe repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the LI. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and ſtretched out her Head on the Block, which upon the ſignal given, was cut off. Her Death was as much lamented, as her Life had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170737:300"/>It affected Judge <hi>Morgan,</hi> that had pronounced the Sentence, ſo much, that he run mad, and thought ſhe ſtill followed him. The Queen her ſelf was troubled at it; for it was rather reaſon of State, than private Reſentment, that ſet her on to it.</p>
               <p>Her Father was ſoon after tried by his Peers, and Condemned and Executed.
<note place="margin">Several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</note> He was the leſs pitied, becauſe by his means his Daughter was brought to her untimely end. <hi>Wiat</hi> was brought to his Trial, he begged his Life in a moſt abject manner, but he was Condemned and Executed, and ſo were Fifty-eight more: Six hundred of the Rabble were appointed to come with Ropes about their Necks, and beg the Queen's pardon, which was granted them. A ſlander was caſt on the Earl of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as if they had ſet on the riſing that was intended in the Weſt. <hi>Wiat,</hi> in hopes of Life, had accuſed them, but he did them Juſtice at his Death; yet they were both put in Priſon upon it. Sir <hi>Nicolas Throgmorton</hi> was accuſed of the ſame crime, but after a long Trial, he was acquitted, yet his Jury were hardly uſed, and ſeverely fined. Sir <hi>Jo. Cheek</hi> was ſought for: ſo he fled beyond Sea, but both he, and Sir <hi>Peter Carew,</hi> hoping that <hi>Philip</hi> would be glad to ſignalize his firſt coming to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with Acts of Grace, rendred themſelves to him: After that, <hi>Cheek</hi> was again taken in <hi>Flanders,</hi> upon a new ſuſpicion, and to deliver himſelf out of his trouble, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170737:301"/>his Religion: But though he got his Liberty upon that, yet he could never recover the quiet of his mind; ſo he lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for ſome time and dyed.</p>
               <p>There was at this time a baſe Impoſture diſcovered in <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Spirit In the Wall.</note> one ſeemed to ſpeak out of a Wall, in a ſtrange tone of Voice. Great numbers flockt about the Houſe, and ſeveral things, both relating to Religion, and the State, were uttered by it; but it was found to be one <hi>Elizabeth Crofts,</hi> who by the help of a Whiſtle ſpoke thoſe words through a Hole in the Wall. There was no other Complice found, but one <hi>Drake,</hi> and they both were made to do Penance for it publickly at S. <hi>Pauls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Injunctions were now given to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<note place="margin">Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſent to the Biſhops.</note> to execute ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Laws, as had been in force in K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s time: That in their Courts they ſhould proceed in their own Names, that the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy ſhould be no more exacted: none ſuſpected of Hereſie was to be put in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; they were required to ſuppreſs He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and Hereticks, and to turn out all married Clergymen, and to ſeparate them from their Wives: If they left their Wives, they might put them in ſome other Cure, or reſerve a Penſion for them, out of their Livings: none that had vowed Chaſtity, was to be ſuffered to live with his Wife: thoſe that were ordained by the Book, ſet out in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by all the other Rites then left out,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170737:301"/>and that was declared to be no valid Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>
               <p>The Queen gave alſo a ſpecial Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Bonner, Gardiner, Tonſtall, Day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out.</note> and <hi>Kitchin,</hi> to proceed againſt the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and the Biſhops of St. <hi>Davids, Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and to deprive them of their Biſhopricks, for having contracted Marriage, and thereby having broken their Vows, and defiled their Function. <q rend="inline">She alſo authoriſed them, to call before them the Biſhops of <hi>Lincoln, Gloceſter</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> who held their Biſhopricks, only during their good behaviour, and ſince they had done things contrary to the Laws of God, and the Practice of the Univerſal Church, to declare their Biſhopricks void, <hi>as they were indeed already void.</hi>
                  </q> And thus were ſeven of the Reformed Biſhops turned out at a daſh. It was much cenſured, that thoſe who had married according to a Law then in force, which was now only repealed for the future, ſhould be deprived for it: and this was a new ſeverity: for in former times, when the Popes were moſt ſet againſt the Marriage of the Clergy, it was put to their option, whether they would part with their Wives, or with their Benefices: but none were ſummarily deprived, as was now done. The other Biſhops, without any form of Proceſs, or ſpecial matter objected to them, were turned out, by an Act of meer Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Government. And all this was done by vertue of the Queens being <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> which, though ſhe condemned
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170737:302"/>as a ſinful and ſacrilegious power, yet ſhe now imployed it againſt thoſe Biſhops, whoſe Sees were quickly filled with Men, in whom the Queen confided. <hi>Goodrick</hi> died this Year: It ſeems he complied with the change now made, otherwiſe he that put the Seal to Lady <hi>Jane</hi>'s Patents, could not have eſcaped the being queſtioned for it. He was an ambitious Man, and ſo no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if earthly conſiderations prevailed more with him, than a good Conſcience. <hi>Scory,</hi> that was Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> renounced his Wife, and did Penance for his Marriage, but ſoon after he fled beyond Sea, and returned in the beginning of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s reign: ſo that his Compliance was the effect of his weakneſs and fears. <hi>Barlow</hi> reſigned <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and a Book of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation was publiſhed in his name, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſevere reflections, both on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and on the Reformation it ſelf; but it is not certain, whether it was writ by him, or was only a forgery, put out in his Name: for if he turned ſo heartily, as the ſtrain of that Book runs, it is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he would have been put from his Biſhoprick: but he fled beyond Sea: yet it ſeems, both <hi>Scory</hi> and he, gave great offence by their behaviour; for though they were the only ſurviving Reformed Biſhops, when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſucceeded, yet they were ſo far from being promoted, that they were not ſo much as reſtored to their former Sees, but put in meaner ones. By all theſe deprivations and reſignations, there were
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170737:302"/>ſixteen new Biſhops made, which made no ſmall change in the face of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church. Now the Old Service was every where ſet up, in which <hi>Bonner</hi> made ſuch haſt, that before the Royal Aſſent was given to the Bill for it, he began the Old Service and Proceſſions. The firſt opening of it was ſomewhat ſtrange, for it being on Saint <hi>Katherine</hi>'s day, the Quiriſters went up to the Steeple, and ſung the Anthem there, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom for that Day. Great numbers of the Clergy were ſummarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived for being Married, they were eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by <hi>Parker</hi> to be 12000. and moſt of them were judged upon common fame, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Proceſs, but a Citation; and many being then in Priſon, yet were Cenſured, and put out for Contumacy, and held guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Many Books were written againſt the Marriage of the Clergy, and the accuſing them of Impurity and ſenſuality on that account, was one of the chief Topicks uſed by the Popiſh Clergy, to diſgrace the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, which made ſome recriminate too indecently, and lay open the filthineſs of the Unmarried Clergy, and thoſe that were called Religious, who led moſt irregular lives; in particular, it was ſaid <hi>Bonner</hi> had no reaſon to be a friend to that ſtate, for he was the Baſtard of a Baſtard, and his Father, though a Prieſt, begat him in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
               <p>On the 2d. of <hi>April</hi> a Parliament met,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> but the moſt conſiderable Members were before-hand corrupted by <hi>Gardiner,</hi> who
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170737:303"/>gave them Penſions, ſome 200. and others 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Year for their Voices. The firſt Act that paſt was declaratory, that all the Prerogatives and Limitations, which by Law belonged to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were the ſame, whether the Crown fell into the hands of a Male or a Female. The ſecret of this was little known, ſome were afraid there was an ill deſign in it, and that it being declared that ſhe had all the authority, which any of her Progenitors ever had, it might be inferred from thence, that ſhe might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a right of Conqueſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make the Queen ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute.</note> and ſo ſeize on the Eſtates of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror had done. But it was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the Queen was put under the fame limitations, as well as acknowledged to have the ſame Prerogatives, with her Progenitors: The ſecret of this was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſcovered. A projecting Man, that had ſerved <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and loved to meddle much, had been deeply engaged both in Lady <hi>Jane</hi>'s buſineſs, and in the late Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and was now in danger of his life, ſo he made application to the Emperour's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, and by his means obtained his Pardon. He offered a Project, that the Queen ſhould declare, that ſhe ſucceeded to the Crown by the Common-Law, but was not tied by the Statute-Law, which did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bind Kings, and therefore a Queen was not obliged by it, thus ſhe might pretend to be a Conqueror, and rule at pleaſure: and by this means might reſtore both Religion, and the <hi>Abbey</hi>-Lands, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170737:303"/>no reſtraint: This the Ambaſſadour brought to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and prayed her to keep it very ſecret. But ſhe diſliked it, yet ſhe ſent for <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and charged him to give her his Opinion of it ſincerely, as he would anſwer to God for it, at the Great Day. He read it carefully, and told her it was a moſt pernicious contrivance, and beg'd her not to liſten to ſuch Plat-forms, which might be brought her by baſe Sycophants: Upon that, ſhe burnt the Paper, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Ambaſſadour not to bring her any more ſuch Projects. This gave <hi>Gardiner</hi> great apprehenſions of the miſchiefs that <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Counſels might bring on the Nation, and ſo he procured the Act to be made, by which the Queen was bound by the Law, as much as her Anceſtors were. He alſo got an Act to be paſt, ratifying the Articles of the Marriage, with ſtrong clauſes, for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Government entirely in the Queen's hands; that ſo <hi>Philip</hi> might not take it on him, as <hi>Henry</hi> the VII. had done, when he married the Heir of the Houſe of <hi>York:</hi> for, as he ſet up a Title in his own Name, and kept the Government in his own hands; ſo the <hi>Spaniards</hi> began to reckon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent from <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> which made <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner</hi> the more cautious: and it muſt be confeſſed, that the preſerving the Nation out of the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt only owing to his care and wiſdom. The Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham</hi> was again reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, after a vigorous reſiſtance made by thoſe of <hi>Gateſide</hi> near <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> The At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainders
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170737:304"/>of the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and Fifty-eight more, for the late Rebellion, were confirmed: The Commons ſent up four ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Bills againſt <hi>Lollard</hi>'s, one confirming the Act of the ſix Articles, and others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Erroneous Opinions, but they were all laid aſide by the Lords: for the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Members in the lower Houſe, were offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to ſhew their Zeal for <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery:</hi> Another Bill was ſent up by them, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to trouble any for poſſeſſing <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey</hi> Lands. But it was ſaid this was prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous to begin with a limitation of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s authority, before they had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that he had any power at all in <hi>England:</hi> and that would come in more properly, after they had reconciled the Nation to him.</p>
               <p>During this Parliament,

When <hi>Cranmer</hi> was brought before them, and they exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to return to the unity of the Church; he anſwered, that he was always for that Unity, which could conſiſt with truth. They
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170737:304"/>fell into a long diſpute concerning the words of the Inſtitution, that they muſt be true, for Chriſt was Truth, and was then making his Teſtament: many Paſſages of the Fathers were alſo alledged againſt him; it was ſaid that he had tranſlated many things falſly out of the Fathers, in his Book: and the Prolocutor called him often an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and Impudent Man:</hi> But he carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with that gravity and mildneſs, that many were obſerv'd to be much affected at it, and to weep: he vindicated his ſincerity in his Book, he ſhewed that Figurative ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were true, and when the Figures were clearly underſtood, they were likewiſe plain, he ſaid, the Sacrament was effectually and really Chriſts Body, as it was broken on the Croſs, that is, his Paſſion effectually appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us. The whole action was carried with ſuch hiſſing and inſulting, and ended with ſuch ſhouts of Triumph, as if <hi>Cranmer</hi> had been quite baffled, that it was viſible there was nothing intended, but to abuſe the ignorant People, and make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was run down. <hi>Ridley</hi> was brought out next day, he began with deep Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his ſincerity, and that he had chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Opinion he had been bred up in, meerly upon the force of Truth; he argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Scriptures, that ſpeak of Chriſts leaving the World, and ſitting at the right hand of God; and that the Sacrament was a Memorial, which good and bad might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually receive; that it was againſt the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, to ſwallow down a living
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170737:305"/>Man; that this Opinion was contrary to the humanity of Chriſt, and was a new Doctrin, unknown to the Fathers, and brought into the Church in the later Ages. <hi>Smith</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him, from Chriſt's appearing to Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> and to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that he might be in more places at once. <hi>Ridley</hi> ſaid, Chriſt might either come down and appear to them, or a Repreſentation might be made of him, but he could not be both in Heaven and Earth at once. Many of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s expreſſions were alledged, but he ſaid, theſe were Rhetorical figures, and to be explained by other plainer paſſages. The diſpute was carried on with the ſame Inſultings, that had been uſed the Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and in concluſion, <hi>Weſton</hi> the Prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor ſaid, they ſaw the Obſtinacy, Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, and Inconſtancy of that Man, but they ſaw likewiſe the force of Truth; ſo he bid them cry out with him, <hi>Truth has the Victory:</hi> upon which that was ecchoed over and over again, by the whole Aſſembly. <hi>Latimer</hi> was brought out next Day, he told them he was Fourſcore Years old, and not fit for diſputing, ſo he would declare his Opinion, and then leave them to ſay what they pleaſed. He thought the Sacrament was only a Memorial of Chriſt, all who fed on Chriſt had Eternal life, and therefore that feeding could not be meant of the Sacrament, ſince both good and bad received it; he ſaid, his Memory was much impaired, but his Faith was founded on the Word of God; ſo though he could not diſpute well, yet his
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170737:305"/>Faith was firmly rooted: Upon this there were extraordinary ſhouts raiſed, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole Debates, the noiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order was ſuch, that it lookt liker a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Game, than a Diſpute among Divines; four or five ſpoke oft at once, ſo that it was not poſſible to hear what they ſaid, much leſs to anſwer it. The Committee of Convocation condemned them all, as obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Hereticks, and declared them to be no Members of the Church: They appealed from their Sentence to the Judgment of God, and expreſſed great joy in the hopes they had, they ſhould glorifie God by dying for his Truth. <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſent a Petition to the Council, complaining of the diſorder of theſe Diſputes, and of hudling them up in ſuch haſt, that it was viſible, nothing was intended by them, but to ſhuffle up things ſo, that the World might be more eaſily abuſed with the name of a Diſputation. But this was not delivered, for it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to keep up this boaſting, that the Champions of the Reformation were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly baffled.</p>
               <p>It was alſo reſolved to carry ſome of the Priſoners, that were in <hi>London,</hi> to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and there to erect new Trophies in the ſame manner, they had done at <hi>Oxford.</hi> Upon this, three of the impriſoned Biſhops, and ſeven Divines, ſigned a Paper, by which they declared, that they would engage in no diſpute, except it were in Writing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were in the preſence of the Queen,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170737:306"/>or the Council, or before either of the Houſes of Parliament. It was viſible, the deſign of diſputing was not to find out the Truth, otherwiſe it had been done, before theſe Points had been ſo poſitively determined: but now there was no benefit to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it; nor could they look for fair dealing, where their Enemies were to be their Judges: nor would they ſuffer them to ſpeak their minds freely, and after ſo long an Impriſonment, their Books and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers being kept from them, they could not be furniſhed to anſwer many things that might be objected to them. Then they added a ſhort account of their Perſwaſions in the chief points of Controverſie, which they would be ready to defend on fair and equal terms: and concluded with a charge to all People not to Rebel againſt the Queen, but to obey all her Commands, that were not contrary to the Law of God.</p>
               <p>In <hi>July,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Pr. of <hi>Spain</hi> lands, and marries the Queen.</note> Prince <hi>Philip</hi> landed at <hi>Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton:</hi> when he ſet foot to Land, he drew his Sword, and carried it a little way naked in his hand. This was interpreted, as a ſign, that he intended to rule by the Sword, but his friends ſaid, it imported, that he would draw his Sword for the defence of the Nation. The Mayor of <hi>Southampton</hi> brought him the Keys of the Town, which he took from him, and gave them back, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſhew of his being pleaſed with this expreſſion of that reſpect done him. This not being ſutable to the Genius of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170737:306"/>that is much taken with the gracious looks of their Princes, was thought a ſign of vaſt pride and moroſeneſs. The Queen met him at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> where they were married: he being then in the XXVII. and ſhe in the XXXVIII. Year of her Age. The Emperour reſigned to him his Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and his more valuable one of <hi>Naples,</hi> ſo they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed with a Pompous Enumeration of their Titles. The Kings gravity was very unacceptable to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who love a mean between the ſtiffneſs of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and the gaiety of the <hi>French.</hi> But if they did not like his temper, they were out of meaſure in love with his Bounty and Wealth: for he brought over a vaſt Treaſure with him, the greateſt part of which was diſtributed among thoſe, who for his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gold, had ſold their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and Religion. At his coming to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> he procured the Pardon of many Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and among others, of <hi>Holgate</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> of whom I find no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made after this. It is very likely he changed his Religion, otherwiſe it is not probable that <hi>Philip</hi> would have interceded for him. He alſo interpoſed for preſerving Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire. Gardiner</hi> was much ſet againſt them, and thought they made but half work, as long as ſhe lived. <hi>Wiat</hi> had accuſed them, in hopes of ſaving his life, but when that did not preſerve him, he did publickly vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them on the Scaffold. The Earl of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170737:307"/>
                  <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> to be freed from all jealouſie, went beyond Sea, and dyed a Year after in <hi>Italy,</hi> as ſome ſay, of Poiſon. <hi>Philip</hi> at firſt took care to preſerve Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> on a generous account, pitying her Innocence, and hoping by ſo acceptable an act of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to recommend himſelf to the Nation: but Intereſt did ſoon after fortifie thoſe good and wiſe Inclinations, for when he grew to be out of hope of iſſue by the Queen; he conſidered that the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who was ſoon after married to the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> was next in ſucceſſion after La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> ſo if ſhe ſhould be put out of the way, the Crown of <hi>England</hi> would have become an Acceſſion to the <hi>French</hi> Crown: and therefore he took care to preſerve her, and perhaps he hoped to have wrought ſo much on her, by the good offices he did her, that if her Siſter ſhould dye without Children, ſhe might be induced to marry him. But this was the only grateful thing he did in <hi>England.</hi> He affected ſo extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant a ſtate, and was ſo ſullen and ſilent, that it was not eaſie for any to come within the Court, and Acceſs to him was not to be had, without demanding it with almoſt as much formality as Ambaſſadours uſed, when they deſired an Audience: So that a General diſcontent was quickly ſpread into moſt places of the Kingdom, only <hi>Gardiner</hi> was well pleaſed, for the Conduct of affairs was put entirely in his hands. Many mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reports were ſpread of the Queen, particularly in <hi>Norfolk;</hi> at one of theſe the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170737:307"/>Queen was much concerned, which was, that ſhe was with Child before the King came over; but after great examinations, nothing could be made out of it.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops went to make their Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this Summer,
<note place="margin">The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops viſit their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes.</note> to ſee whether the old Service, with all its Rites, was again ſet up; they alſo enquired concerning the lives and labours of the Clergy, of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and their living chaſtly; whether they were ſuſpected of Hereſie, or of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Hereticks? whether they went to Taverns or Alehouſes? whether they admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any to officiate, that had been Ordained ſchiſmatically, before they were reconciled, or to preach, if they had not obtained a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence? whether they viſited the ſick, and adminiſtred the Sacraments reverently? whether they were guilty of Merchandiſe, or Uſury? and whether they did not once every Quarter at leaſt, expound to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Elements of the Chriſtian Religion in the Vulgar Tongue? They did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſteadily, in relation to the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time; for at this time all that they did, was to add the Ceremonies that were then left out in the Book of Ordinations: but afterwards they carried themſelves, as if they had eſteemed thoſe Orders of no force; and therefore they did not degrade thoſe Biſhops or Prieſts, that had been ordained by it: Nor has the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> been ſteady in this matter, for though upon ſome Schiſms, they
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170737:308"/>have annulled all Ordinations made in them; yet they have not annulled the Ordinations of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, though they eſteem the <hi>Greeks</hi> both Hereticks and Schiſmaticks: Thus there were many queſtions put in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Articles of the Viſitation, yet theſe were asked only for form, the main buſineſs was Hereſie, and the performing all Offices according to the old cuſtomes: and the leaſt failing in theſe matters, was more ſeverely enquired after, and more exemplarily puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, than far greater offences. <hi>Bonner</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelf like a Madman, and it was ſaid by his friends, to excuſe the Violences of his rage, that his brains were a little diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his long Impriſonment: for if either the Bells had not rung, when he came near any Church, or if he had not found the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment expoſed, he was apt to break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fouleſt language: and not content with that, he was accuſtomed to beat his Clergy, when he was diſpleaſed with any thing: for he was naturally cruel and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. He took care to have thoſe places of Scripture, that had been painted on the Walls of the Churches to be waſhed off: and upon this it was ſaid, that it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to daſh out the Scripture, to make way for Images, for they agreed ſo ill, that they could not decently ſtand together. Many mock Poems and Satires were flying up and down; but none was more provoking, than one that followed on an Accident at Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> on <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Day: The cuſtom was to lay the Hoſt in the Sepulchre at Even-Song,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170737:308"/>on <hi>Good</hi>-Friday, and to take it out on <hi>Eaſter</hi> Morning; and the Quire Sung theſe words, <hi>He is riſen, he is not here,</hi> when it was taken out: but when they lookt to take it out, they found it was not <hi>there</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for one had ſtollen it away, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was quickly brought; ſo a Ballad was made, that their God was loſt, but a new one was put in his room: Great pains were taken to diſcover the Author of this, but he was not found.</p>
               <p>The Queens third Parliament met on the 11th. of <hi>November:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> In the Writ of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons the Queens Title of <hi>Supream Head</hi> was left out, though ſhe had hitherto not only uſed the name, but had aſſumed the power Imported by it, to a high degree. <hi>Pool</hi> was now ſuffered to come ſo near as <hi>Flanders;</hi> and the Temper of the Parliament being quickly found to be favourable to the work he came for, the Queen ſent two Lords, <hi>Paget</hi> and <hi>Haſtings</hi> for him. Both King and Queen rode in ſtate to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and each had a Sword of ſtate carried before them. The firſt Bill that paſt, was a Repeal of <hi>Pool</hi>'s Attainder, it was read by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons three times in one Day; and the Bill was paſſed without making a Seſſion by a ſhort Prorogation. He came over, and entred privately to <hi>London,</hi> on the 24th. of <hi>November,</hi> for the <hi>Pope</hi>'s authority not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet acknowledged, he could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as a Legate. His Inſtructions were full, beſides the authority commonly lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170737:309"/>with Legates; which conſiſts chiefly in the many Graces and Diſpenſations, that they are impowered to grant; though it might be expected, that they ſhould come rather to ſee the Canons obeyed, than bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: only the more ſcandalous abuſes were ſtill reſerved to the Popes themſelves, whoſe ſpecial Prerogative it has always been, to be the moſt Eminent Tranſgreſſors of all Canons and Conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pool</hi> made his firſt Speech to the King and Queen,
<note place="margin">The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is reconciled to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> and then to the Parliament, in the Name of the Common Paſtor, inviting them to Return to the Sheepfold of the Church. The Queen felt a ſtrange emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of joy within her, as he made his Speech, which ſhe thought was a Child quickned in her Belly: and the flattering Court Ladies heightned her belief of it. The Council ordered <hi>Bonner</hi> to ſing <hi>Te De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi> and there were Bonefires, and all other publick demonſtrations of joy upon it. The Prieſts ſaid, that here was another <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> to come, that leapt in his Mother's Belly, upon the Salutation from Chriſt's Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car. Both Houſes agreed on an Addreſs to the King and Queen, that they would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with the Legate, to reconcile them to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and they offered to repeal all the Laws they had made againſt the <hi>Pope</hi>'s authority, in ſign of their repentance. Upon this, the Cardinal came to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He firſt thanked them for repealing his Attainder, in recompence of which, he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170737:309"/>was now to reconcile them to the Body of the Church: He made a long Speech, of the Converſion of the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> to the Faith, and of the Obedience they had payed to the Apoſtolick See; and of the many favours that See had granted the Crown, of which none was more Eminent than the Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith.</hi> The ruine of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and the diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Confuſions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had been in, ſince they departed from the Unity of the Church, might convince them of the neceſſity of keeping that bond entire. In Concluſion, he gave them and the whole Nation a Plenary Abſolution. The reſt of the Day was ſpent in ſinging <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and the Night in Bonefires. The Act, repealing all Laws made againſt the <hi>Popes</hi> authority, was quickly paſt, only it ſtuck a little, by reaſon of a Proviſo, which the Houſe of Lords put in for ſome Lands, which the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> had of the See of <hi>London,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the Commons oppoſed ſo much, that after the Bill was offered to the Royal aſſent, it was cut out of the Parchment by <hi>Gardiner.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">They did enumerate and repeal all Acts made ſince the 20th. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. againſt the <hi>Pope</hi>'s authority, but all foundations of Biſhopricks and Cathedrals, all Marriages, tho' contrary to the Laws of the Church, all Inſtitutions, all Judicial Proceſſes, and the ſettlements made, either of Church or <hi>Abbey</hi>-Lands, were confirmed. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had joyned their Interceſſion with the Cardinal, that he
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170737:310"/>would confirm the right of the preſent Poſſeſſors of thoſe Lands: Upon which he did confirm them, but he added a heavy charge, requiring thoſe that had any of the Goods of the Church, to remember the Judgments of God that fell on <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> for profaning the holy Veſſels, though they were not taken away by himſelf, but by his Father; and that, at leaſt, they would take care, that ſuch as ſerved the Cures ſhould be ſufficiently maintained: all which was put in the Act, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by it, and it was declared, that all Suits concerning thoſe Lands were to be tried in the Civil Courts: and that it ſhould be a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> if any went about to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Poſſeſſors, by the pretence of an Eccleſiaſtical power. They alſo declared, that the Title of <hi>Supream Head of the Church,</hi> did never of right belong to the Crown; &amp; enacted that it ſhould be left out of Writs in all time coming. All Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons granted to Monaſteries, and now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in Lay-hands, were taken away, and all Churches were made ſubject to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Juriſdiction, except <hi>Weſtminſter, Windſor,</hi> and the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> The ſtatute of Mortmain was repealed for 20. years to come, and all things were brought back to the ſtate in which they were, in the 20th. year of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s reign.</q> The Lower Houſe of Convocation gave occaſion to many clauſes in this Act, by a Petition which they made to the Upper-houſe, <q rend="inline">conſenting to the ſettlement made of Church and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170737:310"/>
                     <hi>Abbey</hi> Lands; and praying that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Mortmain might be repealed, and that all the Tithes might be reſtored to the Church: they propoſed alſo ſome things in relation to Religion, for the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and burning all Heretical Books; and that great care ſhould be had of the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and venting of Books, that the Church ſhould be reſtored to its former Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that Pluralities and Non-reſidence might be effectually condemned, and all Simoniacal pactions puniſhed, that the Clergy might be diſcharged of paying firſt-fruits and Tenths, that Exemptions might be taken away, that all the Clergy ſhould go in their Habits, and that they ſhould not be ſued in a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> till a Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were firſt ſerved and diſobeyed, that ſo they might not be ſurpriſed and ruined a ſecond time.</q> By another Bill all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Acts made againſt <hi>Lollards</hi> were revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The Commons offered another Bill for voiding all Leaſes made by married Prieſts, but it was laid aſide by the Lords. Thus were the Penſioners and aſpiring Men in the Houſe of Commons, either redeeming former faults, or hoping to merit highly by the forwardneſs of their Zeal. By another Bill ſeveral things were made Treaſon: and <q rend="inline">it was declared, that if the Queen died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, and left any Children, the King ſhould have the Government in his hands, till they were of Age; and during that time the conſpiring his Death was made <hi>Treaſon,</hi> but none were to be tried
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170737:311"/>for words, but within ſix Months after they were ſpoken.</q> Another Act paſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring it Treaſon in any to pray for the Queens death, unleſs they repented of it, and in that caſe they were to ſuffer Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment at the Judges diſcretion. A ſevere Act was alſo paſſed againſt all that ſpread lying Reports of the King, the Queen, the Peers, Judges, or great Officers. Some were to loſe their Hands, others their Ears, and others were to be fined according to the degree of their offence.</p>
               <p>And thus all affairs were carried in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gardiners</hi> policy in the ſteps of this change.</note> as well as the Court could wiſh: and upon this, <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s reputation was much raiſed, for bringing about ſo great a change in ſo little time, with ſo little op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. He took much pains to remove all the Objections, that were generally made uſe of: they were chiefly two, the one was the fear of coming under ſuch Tyranny from <hi>Rome,</hi> as their Anceſtors had groaned under; and the other was the loſs of the <hi>Abbey</hi>-Lands. But to the firſt, he ſaid, that all the old Laws againſt Proviſions from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould ſtill continue in force: and to ſhew them, that Legates ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe no dangerous authority in <hi>England,</hi> he made <hi>Pool</hi> take out a Licence, under the Great Seal, for his Legatine power. As for the other, he promiſed both an Act of Parliament, and Convocation, confirming them, and undertook that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould ratifie theſe, as well as his Legate did now conſent to them. But to all this, it was
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170737:311"/>anſwered, that if the Nation were again brought under the old Superſtition, and the Papal authority eſtabliſhed, it would not be poſſible to bridle that power, which would be no longer kept within limits, if once they became Maſters again, and brought the World under a blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It was objected, that the Church-Lands muſt be certainly taken back, it was not likely the <hi>Pope</hi> would confirm the alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them; but though he ſhould do it, yet his Succeſſors might annul that as ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious. And it was obſerved in the charge, which <hi>Pool</hi> gave to all, to make reſtitution; &amp; by the repeal of the ſtatute of Mortmain, that it was intended to poſſeſs the Nation with an Opinion of the Unlawfulneſs of keeping thoſe Lands, which would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly work much on Men that were near death, and could not reſiſt the terrours of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or perhaps of Hell, for the ſin of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and ſo would be eaſily induced to make reſtitution of them, eſpecially at ſuch a time when they were not able to poſſeſs them any longer themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now the Parliament was at an end:
<note place="margin">Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about the way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt Hereticks.</note> and the firſt thing taken into conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was, what way they ought to proceed againſt the Hereticks. <hi>Pool</hi> had been ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to bear ſome favour to them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, but he took great care to avoid all occaſions of being any more blamed for that: and indeed he lived in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of all the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that he opened his thoughts to very few: for his chief
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170737:312"/>Confidents were two <hi>Italians</hi> that came over with him, <hi>Priuli</hi> and <hi>Ormaneto.</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Cecyl,</hi> who in matters of Religion complied with the preſent time, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have more of his favour than any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man had. <hi>Pool</hi> was an Enemy to all ſevere proceedings, he thought Churchmen ſhould have the tenderneſs of a Father, and the care of a Shepherd, and ought to reduce, but not devour the ſtray ſheep: he had obſerved that Cruelty ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inflamed than cured that Diſtemper: he thought the better and ſurer way, was to begin with an effectual Reformation of the manners of the Clergy, ſince it was the ſcandals given by their ill conduct and Ignorance, that was the chief cauſe of the growth of Hereſie: ſo he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if a Primitive Diſcipline ſhould be revived, the Nation would by degrees lay down their prejudices, and might in time be gained by gentle methods. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner,</hi> on the other hand, being of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and cruel temper himſelf, thought the ſtrict execution of the Laws againſt the <hi>Lollards,</hi> was that to which they ought chiefly to truſt: if the <hi>Preachers</hi> were made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Examples, he concluded the People would be eaſily reclaimed: for he pretended, that it was viſible, if King <hi>Henry</hi> had executed the Act of the ſix Articles vigorouſly, all would have ſubmitted: he confeſſed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Clergy was a good thing, but all times could not bear it: if they ſhould proceed ſeverely againſt ſcandalous
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170737:312"/>Churchmen, the Hereticks would take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from that, to defame the Church the more, and raiſe a clamour againſt all Clergymen. <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s ſpite was at this time much whetted by the reprinting of his Books of true Obedience, which was done at <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and ſent over. In it he had called King <hi>Henry</hi>'s marriage with Queen <hi>Catherine, Inceſtuous,</hi> and had juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Divorce, and his <hi>ſecond Marriage with his moſt godly and vertuous Wife, Queen Anne.</hi> This was a ſevere expoſing of him, but he had brow enough, and bore down theſe reproaches, by ſaying <hi>Peter</hi> had denied his Maſter: but others ſaid a Compliance of 25. years continuance was very unjuſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a ſudden denial, that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently expiated with ſo ſincere a Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The Queen was for joining both theſe Councils together, and intended to proceed at the ſame time, both againſt ſcandalous Churchmen and Hereticks. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Parliament was over, there was a ſolemn Proceſſion of many Biſhops and Prieſts, <hi>Bonner</hi> carrying the Hoſt, to thank God for reconciling the Nation again to Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair; and it having been done on St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Day, that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be an Anniverſary, and was called <hi>The Feaſt of the Reconciliation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſoon after began the Perſecution:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1555"/> 
                  <hi>Rogers, Hooper, Taylor, Bradford,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſet on foot.</note> and ſeven more were brought before the Council, and asked one by one, if they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:170737:313"/>to the Union of the Catholick Church, and acknowledge the <hi>Pope:</hi> but they all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered reſolutely, that they had renounced the <hi>Pope</hi>'s power, as all the Biſhops had alſo done; they were aſſured he had no authority, but over his own Dioceſs, for the firſt four Ages, ſo they could not ſubmit to his Tyranny. <hi>Gardiner</hi> told them, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was now offered them, but if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it, Juſtice would be done next: ſo they were all ſent back to Priſon, except one, who had great Friends, ſo he was only asked, if he would be an honeſt man, and upon that promiſe was diſmiſt. They began with <hi>Rogers,</hi> whoſe Impriſonment was formerly mentioned. Many had adviſed him to make his eſcape, and flie to <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi> but he would not do it, though a Family of Ten Children was a great Temptation.</p>
               <p>Both he and <hi>Hooper</hi> were brought before <hi>Gardiner,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rogers</hi> and <hi>Hooper</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and burnt.</note> 
                  <hi>Bonner, Tonſtall,</hi> and three other Biſhops. They asked them whether they would ſubmit to the Church, or not? but they anſwered, that they looked on the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Antichriſtian. <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> ſaid, that was a reproach on the <hi>Queen. Rogers</hi> ſaid, they honoured the <hi>Queen,</hi> and lookt for no ill at her hands, but as ſhe was ſet on to it by them; Upon that <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner,</hi> and the other Biſhops declared, that ſo far were they from ſetting on the <hi>Queen</hi> to the executing of the Law, that ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to do it, and this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by two Privy Councellours that were
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170737:313"/>preſent. In concluſion, they gave them time till next Morning to conſider what they would do, and then they continuing firm, they declared them obſtinate Hereticks, and degraded them: but they did not eſteem <hi>Hooper</hi> a Biſhop, ſo he was only degraded from the Order of Prieſthood. <hi>Rogers</hi> was not ſuffered to ſee his Wife nor his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet ſo little did this terrible ſentence fright him, that the morning of his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he was ſo faſt aſleep, that he was not eaſily awakened: He was carried from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Smithfield,</hi> on the 4th. of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> a Pardon was offered him at the ſtake, if he would recant, but he refuſed it on ſuch terms; and ſaid he would not exchange a quick fire for Everlaſting burnings, but declared that he reſigned up his Life with joy, as a teſtimony to the Doctrine which he had preached. <hi>Hooper</hi> was ſent to <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> at which he rejoyced, for he hoped by his death to confirm many there. He ſpake to ſeveral, whom he had formerly known, ſome of them, in compaſſion to him, wept by him, which made him ſhed tears; but he ſaid, all he had ſuffered in his Impriſonment, had not moved him to do ſo much: he was burnt on the 9th. of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary:</hi> a Pardon was alſo offered him at the Stake, but to no effect. A great Wind blew while he was burning, and hindred the Flame to riſe up and choke him, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his Vitals; ſo that he was near three quarters of an hour in great Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but he continued ſtill calling on
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170737:314"/>God; his laſt words were, <hi>Lord Jeſus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Spirit. Sanders,</hi> that had been Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter at <hi>Coventry,</hi> and <hi>Taylor</hi> that was Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter at <hi>Hadly,</hi> were at the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and ſent to be burnt at the places where they had ſerved: The former was firſt committed for preaching without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, after the Queens Prohibition; and the latter for making oppoſition to ſome Prieſts, that broke violently into his Church, and ſaid Maſs in it. <hi>Gardiner</hi> was in hope, that theſe four Executions being made in ſeveral parts of <hi>England,</hi> would have ſtruck ſo general a terrour in the whole Party, that there would have been little occaſion for further ſeverities: but when he ſaw ſix more were ſoon after apprehended on the ſame account, and that the ſpirits of thoſe, call'd <hi>Hereticks,</hi> were now rather inflam'd than depreſſed, he reſolved to meddle no more in thoſe Trials; and turned over that Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious matter to <hi>Bonner,</hi> whoſe temper was ſo cruel, that he undertook it cheerfully.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeverities were very hateful to the Nation.
<note place="margin">The burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings much condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> It was obſerved, that in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, thoſe that oppoſed the Laws, were only turned out of their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and ſome few of them were put in Priſon; but now Men were put in Priſon on trifling pretences, and kept there till Laws were made, by which they were condemned meerly for their Opinion, for they had act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing contrary to Law. One Piece of Cruelty was alſo ſingular: when the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170737:314"/>ſent away thoſe that were to be burnt in the Countrey, they threatned to cut out their Tongues, if they would not promiſe to make no Speeches to the People; which they, to avoid that butchery, were forced to promiſe. Some made reflections on the length and ſharpneſs of <hi>Hooper</hi>'s Torment, as a puniſhment on him, for the conteſt he had raiſed in the Church about the Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>Ridley</hi> and he had been entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and writ very affectionate Letters to one another. The ſenſe they had of thoſe differences, when they were preparing for another World, and that bitter paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, through which they were to go to it, ought to inſpire all others with more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thoughts in ſuch matters. Thoſe that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Reformation, were now poſſeſſed with great averſion to the Popiſh Party, and the whole Body of the Nation grew to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like this Cruelty; and came to hate King <hi>Philip</hi> for it. <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours had openly ſaid, that the Queen ſet them on to it, ſo the blame of it was laid on the King, the ſowreneſs of whoſe temper, together with his bigottry in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, made it ſeem reaſonable to charge him with it. He finding that this was like to raiſe ſuch prejudices againſt him, as might probably ſpoil his deſign of making himſelf Maſter of <hi>England,</hi> took care to vindicate himſelf. So his Confeſſor <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> preached a Sermon at <hi>Court,</hi> againſt the taking of Peoples lives for Opinions in Religion; and Inveighed
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170737:315"/>againſt the Biſhops for doing it: By this the blame of it was turned back on them, and this made them ſtop for ſome Weeks; but at laſt they reſolved rather to bear the blame of the Perſecution avowedly, than not to go on in it.</p>
               <p>At this time a Petition was printed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea;
<note place="margin" type="runSum">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and for them.</note> by which the Reformers addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves to the Queen, they ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her the danger of her being carried by a blind zeal, to deſtroy the Members of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> had done before his Converſion: they remembred her of <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to preſerve her Life in her Fathers time: they cited many Paſſages out of the Books of <hi>Gardiner, Bonner</hi> and <hi>Tonſtall,</hi> by which ſhe might ſee that they were not acted by true Principles of Conſcience, but were turned as their Fears or Intereſts led them. They ſhewed her how contrary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution was to the ſpirit of the Goſpel, that Chriſtians tolerated <hi>Jews;</hi> and that <hi>Turks,</hi> notwithſtanding the barbarity of their tempers, and the Cruelty of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yet tolerated Chriſtians. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred her, that the firſt Law for burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>England,</hi> was made by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>IV.</hi> as a reward to the Biſhops, who had helped him to depoſe <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and ſo to mount to the Throne. They repreſented to her, that God had truſted her with the Sword, which ſhe ought to imploy for the protection of her People, &amp; was not to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them to the Cruelty of ſuch Wolves: The
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170737:315"/>Petition alſo turned to the Nobility, and reſt of the Nation, and the dangers of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoke, and a bloody Inquiſition were ſet before them. Upon this the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors writ ſeveral Books in Juſtification of thoſe proceedings. They obſerved that the <hi>Jews</hi> were commanded to put blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to death; and ſaid the Hereticks blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the Body of Chriſt, and called it only a piece of Bread. It became Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be more zealous for the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than Heathens were for the falſe: Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> by a Divine Power, ſtruck <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> dead. Chriſt, in the Parable, ſaid, <hi>Compel them to enter in.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I would they were cut off that trouble you.</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> was once againſt all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities in ſuch caſes, but changed his mind, when he ſaw the good effects that ſome Baniſhments and Fines had on the <hi>Donatiſts:</hi> That on which they inſiſted moſt, was, the burning of <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time. So they were now fortified in their cruel Intentions, and reſolved to ſpare none, of what Age, Sex, or condition ſoever they might be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bonner</hi> kept one <hi>Tomkins,</hi> a Weaver, ſome Months in his Houſe, who was found to doubt of the Preſence in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he uſed divers Violences to him, as the tearing out the Hair of his Beard, and the holding a Candle to his Hand, till the Veins and Sinews burſt; and theſe not prevailing, to make him change, he was
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:170737:316"/>at laſt burnt in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> One <hi>Hunter,</hi> an Apprentice, not above XIX. Years old, was condemned and burnt on the ſame account. <hi>Bonner</hi> was ſo much concerned to preſerve him, that he offered him <hi>Forty Pound</hi> to change: ſo mercenary did he think other Mens conſciences were, meaſuring them probably by his own. Two Gentlemen, <hi>Cauſton</hi> and <hi>Higbed,</hi> one <hi>Lawrence</hi> a Prieſt, and two meaner Perſons, were burnt near their own Houſes in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> The Method in theſe, and in all the other proceedings, during the reſt of this reign, was ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and <hi>ex officio:</hi> Upon complaints made, Perſons were impriſoned, and Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Points, for which they were ſuſpected, were offered to them, which they were required to anſwer; and if their anſwers were Heretical, they were burnt for them, without any thing being obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to them, or proved againſt them. <hi>Ferrar,</hi> that had been Biſhop of S. <hi>Davids,</hi> was dealt with in the ſame manner, by his Succeſſor <hi>Morgan.</hi> When he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, he appealed to Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> but that had no other effect, ſave, that his Execution was ſtopt three Weeks. <hi>Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins White,</hi> a poor Fiſherman, was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Biſhop of <hi>Landaffe,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards burnt: <hi>Marſh</hi> a Prieſt, was burnt at <hi>Cheſter;</hi> and to the ordinary Cruelty of burning, they added a new Invention of pouring melted Pitch on his Head. One <hi>Flower,</hi> a raſh and furious Man, wounded a Prieſt at S. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as he
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170737:316"/>was officiating; for which being ſeiſed on, and found to be an Heretick, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and burnt. The fact was diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all the Reformed, and he became ſincerely Penitent for it, before he died. After this, for ſome Weeks, there was a ſtop put to thoſe ſeverities.</p>
               <p>The Queen about this time ſent for her Treaſurer,
<note place="margin">The Queen reſtores the Church-Lands.</note> and ſome of the other Officers of her Revenue, and told them, that ſhe thought her ſelf bound in Conſcience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore all the Lands of the Church, that were then in her hands; ſhe thought they were unlawfully acquired, and that they could not be held by her without a ſin, therefore ſhe declared ſhe would have them diſpoſed of, as Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> ſhould think fit. Some imputed this to a Bull ſet out by the <hi>Pope,</hi> excommunicating all that kept any Lands belonging to Abbies or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: This alarmed many in <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>Gardiner</hi> pacified them, and told them, that Bull was made only for <hi>Germany,</hi> and that no Bull did bind in <hi>England,</hi> till it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. But this did not ſatisfie Inquiſitive People, for a ſin in <hi>Germany</hi> was likewiſe a ſin in <hi>England,</hi> and if the <hi>Pope</hi>'s authority came from Chriſt, it ought to take place every where equally.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Julius</hi> died in <hi>March,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170737:317"/>nor Kindred to come to <hi>Court,</hi> and reſolved effectually to put down Non-reſidence and Pluralities: but he found it very difficult to bring about the good deſigns he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and that the <hi>Popes</hi> power was ſuch, that it was more eaſie for him to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, than good: which made him once cry out, That he did not ſee how any could be ſaved, that ſat in that Chair. Theſe things wrought ſo much on him, that he ſickned within Twelve Days of his Election, and died Ten Days after that. Upon his death, the Queen endeavoured to engage the <hi>French</hi> to conſent to the Promotion of Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> which ſhe did without his knowledge or approbation: but at <hi>Rome</hi> they were ſo apprehenſive of another <hi>Pope</hi> ſet on Reformations, that they made haſt in their choice; and ſet up <hi>Caraffa,</hi> called <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth, who was the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly ambitious and inſolent <hi>Pope,</hi> that had reigned of a great while.</p>
               <p>On the day of his Election,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours come to <hi>Rome.</hi>

Horſe of their own Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, but the Pope would not admit them to an Audience, till they had accepted of a Grant of the Title of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland;</hi> for he pretended it belonged only to him to confer thoſe Titles. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, it ſeems, knew it was the Queen's mind, that they ſhould in every thing ſubmit to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ſo took that grant from him. Their Publick Audience
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170737:317"/>was given in great Solemnity, in which the <hi>Pope</hi> declared, that in token of his pardoning the Nation, <q rend="inline">he had added to the Crown the Title of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by that Supream Power which God had given him to deſtroy, or to build Kingdomes at his pleaſure. But in private diſcourſe, he complained much, that the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey</hi>-Lands were not reſtored. He ſaid it was beyond his power to confirm Sacriledge, and all were obliged, under the pains of damnation, to reſtore to the laſt farthing, every thing that belonged to the Church: he ſaid likewiſe, that he would ſend over a Collector to gather the <hi>Peter</hi>-Pence, for they could not expect that St. <hi>Peter</hi> would open Heaven to them, ſo long as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him his rights upon Earth.</q> Theſe were heavy tidings to the Lord <hi>Mountacute,</hi> (Sir <hi>Anthony Brown</hi>) whoſe Eſtate conſiſted chiefly of <hi>Abbey</hi>-Lands, that was one of the Ambaſſadours. But the <hi>Pope</hi> would endure to contradiction, and repeated this every time they came to him.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> grow backward in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</note> Orders were ſent to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices to look narrowly to the Preachers of Hereſie, and to have ſecret Spies in every Pariſh, for giving them Information of all Peoples behaviour.

The Council writ to the Great Men of the County, to gather many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and aſſiſt at thoſe Spectacles: and when they heard that ſome had come of their own accord to the burnings at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> they writ to the Lord <hi>Rich</hi> to give their thanks to thoſe Perſons for their Zeal, ſo dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly did they ſtudy to cheriſh a ſpirit of Cruelty among the People. <hi>Bradford,</hi> who had been committed ſoon after he had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Bourne</hi> in the Tumult at Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s, had been condemned with the reſt, and was preſerved till <hi>July.</hi> He was ſo much conſidered, that <hi>Heath</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Day</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter, Weſton</hi> and <hi>Harpsfield,</hi> with the King's Confeſſor, and <hi>Alphonſus à Caſtro</hi> went to ſee, if they could prevail on him, and had long Conferences with him in Priſon, but all to no purpoſe. <hi>Bourn</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and his Brother was Secretary of State; but though <hi>Bradford</hi> had preſerved his life, yet he neither came to viſit him, nor did he interpoſe for his life; on the contrary, it was objected to <hi>Bradford,</hi> that by his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in ſuppreſſing that Tumult, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he had ſet it on: but he appealed to God, who ſaw how unworthily they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him evil for good: and he appealed to <hi>Bourn,</hi> who was ſitting among the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops that judged him, if he had not pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170737:319"/>him for the Paſſion of Chriſt to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his preſervation; and if he had not done it, at the hazard of his own Life: But <hi>Bourn,</hi> as he was aſhamed to accuſe him, ſo he had not the honeſty, nor the courage to vindicate him: a young Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was burnt with him, whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged much in his ſufferings, and in tranſports of joy, he hugged the Faggots that were laid about him. <hi>Thornton, Harps<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> and others, ſet on a Perſecution at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> though Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> was averſe to it, but he durſt not now diſcover ſo much, for the Pope had an inveterate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to him, and was reſolved upon the firſt occaſion to recall him, and for that end, he entred in a Correſpondence with <hi>Gardiner,</hi> who hoped thereby to have been made a Cardinal, and Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury:</hi> and upon the hopes he had of that, he ſtill preſerved <hi>Cranmer,</hi> for tho' he was now condemned for Hereſie, yet the See was not eſteemed void, till he was formally degraded. Some ſaid it was fit to begin with him, that had been the chief promoter of Hereſie in <hi>England.</hi> But <hi>Gardiner</hi> ſaid, it was better to try if it could be poſſible to ſhake him, for it would be a great blow to the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if he could be wrought on to forſake it, whereas if he ſhould be burnt, and ſhould dye with ſuch reſolution as others expreſſed, it would much raiſe the ſpirits of his followers. The See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was now only ſequeſtred in <hi>Pool</hi>'s hands,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170737:319"/>and he being afraid of falling under the <hi>Pope</hi>'s rage, was willing to let the cruel Prebendaries do what they pleaſed. They burnt two Prieſts, and two Laymen at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and ſent a Man and a Woman to be burnt in other Places in <hi>Kent.</hi> Two that belonged to the Dioceſes of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and <hi>Chicheſter</hi> were condemned by <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and were burnt near the places of their abode. There were at this time ſeveral pretended diſcoveries of Plots both in <hi>Dorſetſhire</hi> and <hi>Eſſex:</hi> and Orders were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to draw Confeſſions from ſome that were apprehended, by Torture, but the thing was let fall, for it was grounded only on the ſurmiſes of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>The Queen was this Year rebuilding the Houſe of the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> at <hi>Greenwich,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Religious Houſes ſet up.</note> and had recalled <hi>Peyto</hi> and <hi>Elſton,</hi> of which mention was made, <hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 117. the one ſhe made her Confeſſor, and the other was to be Guardian of that Houſe: The People expreſſed ſuch hatred of them, that as they were paſſing upon the River, ſome threw ſtones at them: but they that did it, could not be diſcovered.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>More</hi>'s Works publiſhed.</note> Judge <hi>Raſtall</hi> publiſhed Sir <hi>Tho. More</hi>'s Works at this time; but as was formerly obſerved, he left out his Letter concerning the Nun of <hi>Kent;</hi> though it lies among his other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in that very Manuſcript, out of which he publiſhed them. He prefixed nothing concerning <hi>More</hi>s Life, to his Works, which makes it highly probable, that he
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170737:320"/>never writ it: for this was the proper time and place for publiſhing it, if he had ever writ it. So that Manuſcript life of <hi>Mores,</hi> pretended to be writ by him, out of which many things have been quoted ſince that time, to the diſgrace of King <hi>Henry,</hi> and <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi> muſt be a later forgery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived in ſpite to Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">The Queen did now go on with her Intentions, of founding Religious Houſes out of thoſe <hi>Abbey</hi>-Lands, that were ſtill in the Crown. She recommended it alſo to the Councils care, that every where there might be good Preaching, and that there might be a Viſitation of the Univerſities: ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that Juſtice might be done on the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, in ſuch a manner, that the People might be well ſatisfied about it, and preſt them to take care, that there might be no Pluralities in <hi>England,</hi> and that the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers might give good Example, as well as make good Sermons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The burnings went on: Seven were burnt in <hi>Auguſt</hi> in ſeveral places; ſix more were burnt in one fire at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and four were burnt in other places, but the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular days are not marked. In <hi>September</hi> five were burnt at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and ſeven in other places. In <hi>October</hi> two were burnt at Ely, by <hi>Shaxton</hi>'s means, who now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated his Apoſtaſie by his Cruelty. The 16th of that month became remarkable by the ſufferings of <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Latimer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi> are burnt.</note> Three Biſhops, <hi>Lincoln, Glouceſter</hi> and <hi>Briſtol</hi> were ſent with a Commiſſion from Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:170737:320"/>to proceed againſt them. <hi>Ridley</hi> ſaid, he payed great reſpect to <hi>Pool</hi> as he was of the Royal Family, and eſteemed him much for his Learning and Vertues, but as he was the Popes Legate, he would expreſs no reverence to him, nor would uncover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before any that acted by authority from him. The Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <q rend="inline">To return to the obedience of the See of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> on whom Chriſt had founded his Church, to which the Ancient Fathers had ſubmitted, and which himſelf had once acknowledged:</q> He began his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with a Proteſtation, <q rend="inline">That he did not thereby ſubmit to the authority of the Pope or his Legate; he ſaid Chriſt had founded his Church not on St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but on the Faith which he had confeſſed: The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> had been held in great eſteem, but that was either on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their perſonal worth, or by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the dignity of the City: He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he had once been involved in that ſuperſtition; but St. <hi>Paul</hi> was once a Blaſphemer: And he had diſcovered ſuch errors in that See, that he would never acknowledge it any more.</q> 
                  <hi>Latimer</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to what he ſaid. A nights reſpite was granted them, but they continuing ſtedfaſt next day, they were condemned as obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Hereticks, and delivered to the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Arm, and the Writs were ſent down for their burning. They prepared themſelves for it with ſuch patience and cheerfulneſs as very much amazed their Keepers: As
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170737:321"/>they were led out, they lookt up to <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s Window, but he was not in it, for he was then held in diſpute by ſome Friers; yet he lookt after them, with a very tender ſenſe of their condition, and prayed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to God to aſſiſt them in their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. When they came to the Stake, they embraced and encouraged one another. <hi>Smith</hi> preached on thoſe words, <hi>If I give my body to be burnt, and have not Charity it profiteth nothing:</hi> And he compared their dying for Hereſie, to <hi>Judas</hi>'s that hanged himſelf. <hi>Ridley</hi> deſired leave to anſwer ſome points in his Sermon; but it was told him, that he was not to be ſuffer'd to ſpeak, except he intended to recant: So he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to God, when he ſaw men were reſolved to be ſo unreaſonable to him. He ſent a deſire to the Queen, in behalf of the Tenants of the Biſhoprick of <hi>London,</hi> from whom he had taken Fines, for which he had renewed their Leaſes; and prayed that either their Leaſes might be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or that their Fines might be reſtored out of his goods, which had been ſeized on when he was firſt put in priſon: After both had prayed, and undreſſed themſelves, the fire was kindled. Some Gun-powder was hanged about their necks, and that being fired, put <hi>Latimer</hi> quickly out of his pain; but <hi>Ridley</hi> had a more lingring tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For they threw on ſo much wood that it was long before the flame broke through it; and his Legs were almoſt wholly conſumed before the flame choaked
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:170737:321"/>him. Thus did theſe two Biſhops end their days and their Miniſtry: The one was eſteemed to be the ableſt of all that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the Reformation, both for Piety, Learning, and ſolidity of Judgement; the other was lookt on as a truly Primitive Biſhop, that ſeemed to have more of the ſimplicity of the firſt Ages, than the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs or the learning of later times. <hi>Ridley</hi> was ill rewarded both by <hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Heath;</hi> he had uſed <hi>Bonner</hi>'s Mother and Friends with great kindneſs, while he was Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> and had kept the latter a year and a half in his houſe, after he fell in trouble, but he made him ill returns; and when he went through <hi>Oxford</hi> he did not ſo much as viſit him: And ſo far had men been taught to put off all humanity, that during their Impriſonment in <hi>Oxford,</hi> none of the Univerſity either came to viſit them, or took care to relieve their neceſſities.</p>
               <p>It was obſerved that <hi>Gardiner</hi> was very impatient to have thoſe Biſhops burnt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gardiners</hi> death.</note> and delayed his dinner that day till the news ſhould be brought him, that the Fire was kindled: But at dinner he was taken with an illneſs, which turned to a ſuppreſſion of Urine, of which he died the twelfth of <hi>November.</hi> He went twice to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was opened the twenty firſt of <hi>October,</hi> but could go abroad no more; he expreſſed great ſorrow for his former ſins, and often ſaid, <hi>He had erred with St.</hi> Peter, <hi>but had not repented with him.</hi> He was belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170737:322"/>to be of noble extraction, though baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly born; for his true father was ſuppoſed to be <hi>Richard Woodvill,</hi> that was Brother to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth's Queen, Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth: And this was believed to be the occaſion of his ſudden preferment to the See of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> So thoſe that reflected on him for his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Married ſtate, ſaid that no wonder if perſons baſely born, as both he and <hi>Bonner</hi> were, had no regard to that ſtate of life. He was learned in the Civil and Canon Law; he had a good <hi>Latin</hi> ſtile, and had ſome knowledge in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, but was a very indifferent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine: He had a quickneſs of apprehenſion, with a great knowledge of mankind, and the Intrigues of Courts: He had all the arts of Inſinuation and Flattery, and was inferiour to none in profound Diſſimulation. He died now when he had the proſpect of a Cardinals Hat, and of all the honours which a Pope, that found him after his own heart, could do him. <hi>Heath</hi> was made Chancellour during pleaſure, and the Queen gave to the See of <hi>York</hi> the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi>'s houſe, fallen to her by his Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in recompence for <hi>White-hall,</hi> and it was afterwards called <hi>York-Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parliament was now aſſembled,
<note place="margin">The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ill pleaſed with the Queens conduct.</note> and it appeared that the Nation was much turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their affections. It was propoſed to give the Queen a Subſidy, and two fifteenths. This was the firſt aid that the Queen
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170737:322"/>had asked, though ſhe was now in the third year of her Reign; and what was now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, was no more than what ſhe might have exacted at her firſt coming to the Crown; and ſince ſhe had forgiven ſo much at her Coronation, it ſeemed unreaſonable to deny it now: Yet great oppoſition was made to it. Many ſaid, the Queen was impoveriſhing the Crown, and giving away the Abbey-Lands, and therefore ſhe ought to be ſupplied by the Clergy, and not turn to the Laity: But it was anſwered, that the Convocation had given her 6 <hi>s.</hi> in the pound, but that would not ſerve her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſions; ſo the debate grew high: But to prevent further heats the Queen ſent a Meſſage, declaring that ſhe would accept the Subſidy without the fifteenths, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it was granted. The Queen ſent for the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, and told him ſhe could not with a good Conſcience exact the Tenths and Firſt fruits of the Clergy, ſince they were given to her Father to ſupport his unlawful dignity, of being the <hi>Supream Head of the Church:</hi> She alſo thought, that all Tythes and Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations were the Patrimony of the Church, and therefore was reſolved to reſign ſuch of them as were in her hands. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part paſt eaſily in the Houſe, but great oppoſition was made to the latter part of her motion: for it was lookt on as a ſtep to the taking all the impropriations out of the hands of the Laity; yet upon a diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Houſe, it went ſo near that 126
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170737:323"/>were againſt it, and 193 were for it, ſo it was carried by 67 voices. A Bill was put in againſt the Dutcheſs of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and ſeveral others that favoured the Reformation, and had gone beyond Sea that they might freely enjoy their Conſciences; requiring them to return, under ſevere penalties: The Lords paſt it, but the Commons threw it out; for they began now to repent of the ſevere Laws they had already conſented to, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to add no more. They alſo rejected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Bill, for incapacitating ſome to be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of Peace, who were complained of for their remiſſneſs in proſecuting Hereticks. An Act was put in for debarring one <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Smith,</hi> who had hired ſome Aſſaſſinates to commit a moſt deteſtable Murder, from the benefit of Clergy; which by the courſe of the Common Law, would have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him. This was an invention of the Prieſts, that if any, who was capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into Orders, and had not been twice married, or had not married a Widow, could read, and vowed to take Orders, he was to be ſaved in many criminal caſes. And it was looked on as a part of the Eccleſiaſtical Immunity; which made diverſe of the Biſhops oppoſe this Act; Yet it paſt, though four of them, and five Temporal Lords proteſted againſt it. There was ſuch heat in the Houſe of Commons in this Parliament, that one Sir <hi>Anth. Kingſton,</hi> who was a great ſtickler, called one day for the Keys of the Houſe; but when the Parliament was diſſolved, he
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170737:323"/>was ſent to the <hi>Tower</hi> for it: He was ſoon after ſet at liberty, but next year he and ſix others, were accuſed of a deſign of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Exchequer: He died before he was brought up to <hi>London;</hi> the other ſix were hanged: But the Evidence againſt them does not appear on Record.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> called a Convocation,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pools</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees for the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Clergy.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt procured a Licence from the Queen, empowering them both to meet, and to make ſuch Canons as they ſhould think fit. This was done to preſerve the Prerogatives of the Crown, and to ſecure the Clergy, that they might not be afterwards brought under a <hi>Praemunire.</hi> In it ſeveral decrees were propoſed by <hi>Pool,</hi> and aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by the Clergy: 1. For obſerving the Feaſt of the Reconciliation made with <hi>Rome,</hi> with great ſolemnity: They alſo condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Heretical Books, and received that expoſition of the Faith which Pope <hi>Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſent from the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> to the <hi>Armenians.</hi> 2. For the decent adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, and putting down the yearly Feaſts in the dedications of Churches. 3. They required all Biſhops and Prieſts to lay aſide Secular cares, and to give themſelves wholly to the Paſtoral charge: And all Pluraliſts were required to reſign all their benefices except one, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two months, otherwiſe to forfeit all. 4. Biſhops were required to preach often, and to provide good Preachers for their Dioceſes, to go over them as their Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. 5. All the Pomp and Luxury of the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170737:324"/>Tables, Servants, and Families of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops was condemned; and they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired chiefly to lay out their Revenues on works of Charity. 6. They were required not to give Orders, but after a long and ſtrict Trial; which they ought to make themſelves, and not to turn it over to others. 7. They were charged not to beſtow Benefices upon partial regards, but to confer them on the moſt deſerving, and to take them bound by Oath, to reſide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. 8. Againſt giving Advowſons before Benefices fell vacant. 9. Againſt Symony. 10. Againſt Dilapidations. 11. For Seminaries in every Cathedral for the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and the Clergy were taxed in a fourth part of their Benefices for their maintenance: The twelfth was about Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p>It was deſigned alſo to ſet out four Books of Homilies: The firſt for points of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; the ſecond was for the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Creed, the Lords Prayer, the ten Commandments, the <hi>Ave,</hi> and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: The third was to be a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe on all the Leſſons on Holy-days; and the fourth was to be concerning the ſeveral Vertues and Vices, and the Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Church. In theſe, the wiſe and good temper of Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> may be well diſcerned. He thought the people were more wrought on by the ſcandals they ſaw in the Clergy, than by the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they heard from the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and therefore he reckoned if Pluralities
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170737:324"/>and Non-reſidences, and the other abuſes of Church-men could have been removed, and if he could have brought the Biſhops to have lived better, and laboured more, to be ſtricter in giving Orders, and more impartial in conferring Benefices, and if he could have eſtabliſhed Seminaries in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals, Hereſie might have been driven out of the Nation by gentler methods than by Racks and Fires: In one thing he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the meanneſs of his Spirit, that though he himſelf condemned cruel proceedings againſt Hereticks, yet he both gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to other Biſhops and Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons to try them, and ſuffered a great deal of Cruelty to be exerciſed in his own Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; but he had not courage enough to reſiſt Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth, who thought of no other way for bearing down Hereſie, but by ſetting up Courts of Inquiſition eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where. He had clapt up Cardinal <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi> that was <hi>Pool</hi>'s great friend, in priſon, upon ſuſpicion of Hereſie; and would very probably have uſed himſelf ſo, if he had got him at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> were at this time beginning to grow conſiderable: They were tied,
<note place="margin">He refuſes to bring the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> beſides their other Vows, to an abſolute obedience to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves every where to open Free Schools, for the education of youth, and to bear down Hereſie. They were excuſed from the hours of the Quire, and ſo were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as a mungrel Order, between the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170737:325"/>Regulars and the Seculars. They propoſed to Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> that ſince the Queen was reſtoring the Abbey-Lands, it would be to little purpoſe to give them again to the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order; which was now rather a clog than a help to the Church: And therefore they deſired that Houſes might be aſſigned to them, for maintaining Schools and Seminaries; and they did not doubt but they ſhould quickly both drive out He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and recover the Church Lands. <hi>Pool</hi> did not liſten to this, for which he was much cenſured by the Fathers of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. It is not certain whether he had then the ſagacity to foreſee that diſorder which they were like to bring into the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, and that corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Morals that had ſince flowed from their Schools, and has been infuſed by them generally in Confeſſions, ſo that their whole Church is now over run with it. Three were burnt at one Stake in <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in <hi>November,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">More of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med are burnt.</note> and <hi>Philpot</hi> was burnt in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> in <hi>December:</hi> he had been put in Priſon, ſoon after that Convocation was diſſolved, in which he had diſputed in the beginning of this Reign: and was now brought out to the Stake.

He had unuſual ſucceſs in his Wars, he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a <hi>Pope,</hi> a King of <hi>France,</hi> and ſome <hi>German</hi> Princes, Priſoners: and had a vaſt acceſſion of Wealth and Empire from the <hi>Weſt</hi>-Indies: but now as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs followed him no more, ſo he was much afflicted with the Gout, and grew to be much out of love with the Pomp and Vanities of this World, and ſo ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to prepare for another Life. He reſigned all his Dominions with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, that was much ſuperiour to all his other Conqueſts. He retired to a private Lodge of ſeven Rooms, that he had ordered to be built for him in the confines of <hi>Portugal:</hi> He kept only twelve Servants to wait upon him, and reſerved
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170737:326"/>for his Expence 100000. Crowns Penſion. In this retreat he lived two years: His firſt year was ſpent chiefly in Mechanical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, in which he took great pleaſure: from that he turned to the cultivating his Garden, in which he uſed to work with thoſe hands, that now preferred the graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pruning Tools, to Scepters and Swords. But after that he addicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more to ſtudy and Devotion, and did often diſcipline himſelf with a Cord. It was alſo believed, that in many points he came to be of the Opinion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, before he died. His Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor was ſoon after his death burnt for Hereſie, and <hi>Miranda</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> that converſed much with him at this time, was clapt into Priſon on the ſame ſuſpicions. At the end of two years he died, having given a great Inſtance of a mind ſurfeited with the Glories of this World, that ſought for quiet in a private Cell, which it had long in vain ſearched after in Palaces and Camps.</p>
               <p>In <hi>March</hi> next Year came on <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Martyrdom.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170737:326"/>derived from the <hi>Pope,</hi> which he ſaid, he would never acknowledge. He could not ſerve two Maſters, and ſince he had ſworn Allegiance to the Crown, he could never ſubmit to the <hi>Pope</hi>'s au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: He alſo ſhewed that the <hi>Pope</hi>'s power had been as unjuſtly uſed, as it was ill grounded: that they had changed the Laws ſetled by Chriſt, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in denying the Chalice, in the Worſhip in an unknown Tongue, and in their pretences to a power to depoſe Princes: he remembred <hi>Brooks,</hi> that he had ſworn to maintain the King's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and when he ſtudied to caſt that back on him, as an invention of his, he told him that it was acknowledged in his Predeceſſor <hi>Warham</hi>'s time, and that <hi>Brooks</hi> had then ſet his hand to it.</q> 
                  <hi>Brooks,</hi> and the two Delegates, <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Scory,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected many things to him, as that he had flattered King <hi>Henry,</hi> that ſo he might be preferred by him, and that he had condemned <hi>Lambert</hi> for denying the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the Sacrament, and had been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards guilty of the ſame Hereſie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

He confeſſed he had changed his Opinion in the matter of the Sacrament, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that he had been twice married;
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170737:327"/>which he thought was free to all Men, and was certainly much better than to defile other Men's Wives: After much diſcourſe had paſt on both ſides, <hi>Brooks</hi> required him to appear before the <hi>Pope</hi> within Eighty Days, and anſwer to the things that ſhould be objected to him: he ſaid, he would do it moſt willingly, but he could not poſſibly go, if he were ſtill kept a Priſoner.</p>
               <p>In <hi>February</hi> this Year,
<note place="margin">14 Febr.</note> 
                  <hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Thirleby</hi> were ſent to degrade him, for his Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in not going to <hi>Rome;</hi> when he was all the while kept in Priſon: He was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with all the Pontifical Robes made of Canvas, and then they were taken from him, according to the Ceremonies of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation, in which <hi>Bonner</hi> carried himſelf with all the Inſolence, that might have been expected from him: <hi>Thirleby</hi> was a good natured Man, and had been <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s particular friend, and performed his part in this Ceremony, with great expreſſions of ſorrow, and ſhed many tears at it. In all this <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſeemed very little concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; he ſaid, it was groſs Injuſtice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him for not going to <hi>Rome,</hi> when he was ſhut up in Priſon; but he was not ſorry to be thus cut off, even with all this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry, from any relation to that Church: he denied the <hi>Pope</hi> had any authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, ſo he appealed from his Sentence to a free General Council.</p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:170737:327"/>
               <p>But now many Engines were ſet on work, to make him recant: both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Divines had many Conferences with him,
<note place="margin">He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants.</note> and great hopes were given him, not only of Life, but of Preferment, if he would do it: and theſe at laſt had a fatal effect upon him; for he ſigned a Recantation of all his former Opinions, and concluded it with a Proteſtation, that he had done it freely, only for the diſcharge of his Conſcience. But the <hi>Queen</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make him a Sacrifice to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments; ſhe ſaid, it was good for his own Soul that he repented, but ſince he had been the chief ſpreader of Hereſie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Nation, it was neceſſary to make him a publick Example: ſo the Writ was ſent down to burn him, and after ſome ſtop had been made, in the Execution of it, now Orders came for doing it ſuddenly. This was kept from <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s knowledge, for they intended to carry him to the Stake, without giving him any notice, and ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to make him dye in deſpair: yet he ſuſpecting ſomewhat, writ a long Paper, containing a Confeſſion of his Faith, ſuch as his Conſcience, and not his fears had dictated.</p>
               <p>He was on the 21.
<note place="margin">He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and is burnt.</note> of <hi>March</hi> carried to St. <hi>Maries,</hi> where Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> preached, and vindicated the Queen's Juſtice, in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Cranmer;</hi> but magnified his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion much, and aſcribed it wholly to the workings of God's Spirit: he gave him
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170737:328"/>great hopes of Heaven, and promiſed him all the relief that Diriges and Maſſes could give him in another ſtate. All this while <hi>Cranmer</hi> was obſerved to be in great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and Floods of Tears run from his Eyes; at laſt, when he was called on to ſpeak, he began with a Prayer, in which he expreſſed much inward remorſe and horrour: then after he had exhorted the People to good Life, Obedience and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he in moſt pathetick expreſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his ſin, that the hopes of Life had made him ſign a Paper contrary to the Truth, and againſt his Conſcience: and he had therefore reſolved, that the hand that ſigned it, ſhould be burnt firſt; he alſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he had the ſame belief concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sacrament, which he had publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the Book he writ about it. Upon this there was a great Conſternation on the whole Aſſembly, but they reſolved to make an end of him ſuddenly, ſo without ſuffering him to go further, they hurried him away to the Stake: and gave him all the diſturbance they could, by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and clamours: But he made them no anſwer, having now turned his thoughts wholly towards God. When the Fire was kindled, he held his right Hand towards the Flame, till it was conſumed, and often ſaid, <hi>that unworthy hand;</hi> he was ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quite burnt, only his heart was found entire among the aſhes: from which his Friends made this Inference, that though his Hand had erred, yet it appeared his
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:170737:328"/>Heart had continued true. They did not make a Miracle of it, though they ſaid the Papiſts would have made a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, if ſuch a thing had fallen out in any that had dyed for their Religion.</p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Thomas Cranmer</hi> end his days,
<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> in the LXVII. Year of his Age: He was a Man of great Candor, and a firm Friend, which appeared ſignally in the misfortunes of <hi>Anne Boleyn, Cromwell,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Somerſet:</hi> He rather excelled in great Induſtry and good Judgment, than in a quickneſs of apprehenſion, or a cloſeneſs of ſtile. He employed his Revenues on pious and charitable uſes; and in his Table he was truly hoſpitable, for he entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great numbers of his poor Neighbours often at it. The Gentleneſs and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his deportment were very ſingular: His laſt fall was the greateſt blemiſh of his Life, yet that was expiated by a ſincere repentance, and a patient Martyrdom: and thoſe that compared Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times, did not ſtick to compare him, not only to the <hi>Chryſoſtomes,</hi> the <hi>Ambroſes,</hi> and the <hi>Auſtins,</hi> that were the chief Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Church, in the fourth and fifth Centuries, but to thoſe of the firſt Ages, that immediately followed the Apoſtles, and came neareſt to the Patterns, which they had left the World; to the <hi>Ignatius's,</hi> the <hi>Policarps,</hi> and the <hi>Cyprians.</hi> And it ſeemed neceſſary that the Reformation of the Church, being the reſtoring of the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170737:329"/>Primitive and Apoſtolical Doctrine, ſhould have been chiefly carried on by a Man thus Eminent, for Primitive and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Vertues.
<note place="margin">More bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</note> In <hi>January,</hi> five Men, and two Women were burnt at one Stake in <hi>Smithfield:</hi> and one Man and four Women were burnt at <hi>Canterbury.</hi> In <hi>March,</hi> two Women were burnt at <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> and three Men at <hi>Salisbury.</hi> In <hi>April,</hi> ſix Men of <hi>Eſſex</hi> were burnt in <hi>Smithfield:</hi> a Man and a Woman were burnt at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and another at <hi>Canterbury:</hi> and ſix, who were ſent from <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> were condemned by <hi>Bonner,</hi> without giving them longer time to conſider whether they would recant, than till the Afternoon: for he was now ſo hardned in his Cruelty, that he grew weary of keeping his Priſoners ſome time, and of taking pains on them, to make them recant; he ſent them back to <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> where they were burnt: He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned alſo both a blind Man, and an aged Criple, and they were both burnt in the ſame Fire at <hi>Stratford.</hi> In <hi>May,</hi> three Women were burnt in <hi>Smithfield;</hi> the day after that, two were burnt at <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> one of them being blind. Three were burnt at <hi>Beckles</hi> in <hi>Suffolk;</hi> five were burnt at <hi>Lewis,</hi> and one at <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> But on the 27th. of <hi>June, Bonner</hi> gave the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalleſt Inſtance of his Cruelty, that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ever ſaw: for 11. Men, and two Women were burnt in the ſame Fire at <hi>Stratford.</hi> The horror of this Action it ſeems had ſome Operation on himſelf, for he
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170737:329"/>burnt none till <hi>April</hi> next year. In <hi>June</hi> three were burnt at Saint <hi>Edmondsbury,</hi> and three were afterwards burnt at <hi>Newbury.</hi> This cruelty was not kept within <hi>England,</hi> but it extended as far as to the adjacent Iſlands. In <hi>Guernſey,</hi> a Mother and her two Daughters were burnt at the ſame ſtake; one of them was a married Woman, and big with Child: The violence of the Fire burſting her Belly, the Child that proved to be a Boy, fell out into the Flame: He was ſnatched out of it, by one that was more merciful than the reſt: but the other bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Spectators, after a little Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, threw it back again into the Fire. This was Murder without queſtion, for no Sentence againſt the Mother could excuſe this Inhumane piece of Butchery, which was thought the more odious, becauſe the Dean of <hi>Guernſey</hi> was a Complice in it: yet ſo merciful was the Government under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that he, and Nine others, that were accuſed for it, had their Pardons. Two were after this, burnt at <hi>Greenſtead,</hi> and a blind Woman at <hi>Darby;</hi> Four were burnt at <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and as many at <hi>Mayfield</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and one at <hi>Nottingham:</hi> ſo that in all LXXXV. were this Year burnt, without any regard had, either to Age, or Sex, to young or old, or the Lame and the Blind; which raiſed ſo extream an averſion in this Nation to that Religion, that it is no wonder if the apprehenſions of being again brought under ſo Tyrannical a Yoke, break out into moſt Violent and Convulſive Symptoms.</p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:170737:330"/>
               <p>By theſe means, the Reformation was ſo far from being extinguiſhed, that it ſpread daily more and more, and the Zeal of thoſe that profeſſed it grew quicker.

This raiſed much heat, but Doctor <hi>Cox</hi> that lived in <hi>Strasburg,</hi> being held in great eſteem, went thither, and procured an Order from the Senate, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould continue to uſe the forms of their own Church: but the fire was not thereby quenched, for <hi>Knox,</hi> and ſome other hot ſpirits, began to make exceptions to ſome parts of the Liturgy; and got <hi>Calvin</hi> to declare on their ſide: upon which ſome of them retired to <hi>Geneva.</hi> Another conteſt aroſe concerning the cenſuring of Offenders, which ſome ſaid belonged only to the Miniſter, and

<note place="margin">More Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Houſes.</note> This year ſhe founded Houſes for the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> and <hi>Dominicans</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> as alſo a Houſe for the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> at <hi>Skeen,</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:170737:331"/>and a Nunnery at <hi>Sion:</hi> She alſo converted the Church of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> into an <hi>Abbey.</hi> And that way might be made to the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Religious Orders, ſhe took care to have all the Reports, Confeſſions, and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, that tended to the diſhonour of their Houſes, be raſed: So that no Memory might remain of them to the next Age. For this end ſhe gave a Commiſſion to <hi>Bonner,</hi> and others, to ſearch all Regiſters, and to take out of them every thing, that was either againſt the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Religious Houſes: and they executed this Commiſſion ſo carefully, that the ſteps of it appear in the defectiveneſs of all the Records of that time: yet many things have eſcaped their diligence. This Expurgation of theirs was compared to the rage of the Heathens in the laſt Perſecution, who deſtroyed all the Books and Regiſters, that they could find among the Chriſtians. The <hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Glaſſenbury</hi> were in hope to have got their Houſe, that had been dedicated to the honour of <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> raiſed again: they deſired only the Houſe, and a little Land about it; which they reſolved to Cultivate, and did not doubt but the People of the Countrey would contribute towards their ſubſiſtence: and it is probable that the like deſigns were ſet on foot for the other Houſes: and it was not to be doubted, but that as ſoon as they had again infuſed in the Nation the belief of Purgatory, they would have perſwaded thoſe that held their Lands, eſpecially if they could come near them, when they were dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:170737:331"/>to deliver themſelves from the ſin and puniſhments of Sacriledge; by making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. It is true, the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were much alarmed at theſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: and at the laſt Parliament, many in the Houſe of Commons laid their Hands on their Swords, and declared, that they would not part with their Eſtates, but would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them. Yet all that intended to gain favour at <hi>Court,</hi> made their way to it, by founding Chantries for Maſſes, to be ſaid for them and their Anceſtors; and took out Licences from the <hi>Queen,</hi> for making thoſe Endowments.</p>
               <p>A Truce was now concluded between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> for five years:
<note place="margin">The <hi>Pope</hi> ſets on a War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note> but the Violent <hi>Pope</hi> broke it. He was offended at the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and chiefly at <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s aſſuming the Title of <hi>Emperour,</hi> without his conſent: he uſed to ſay, that all Kingdoms were ſubject to him: that he would ſuffer no Prince to be too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with him: and that he would ſet the World on fire, rather than be driven to do any thing below his Dignity. He pretended that he had reformed the abuſes of his own Court, and that he would in the next place reform all the abuſes that were in other Courts, of which he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great Collection to be made: when he was preſt to call a Council, he ſaid, he needed none; for he himſelf was above all; and the World had already ſeen twice, to how little purpoſe it was to ſend about Sixty weak Biſhops, and Forty Divines,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:170737:332"/>that were not the moſt learned, to <hi>Trent:</hi> he reſolved it ſhould never meet there any more; but he would call one to ſit in the <hi>Lateran:</hi> he ſignified this to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of Princes, only in courteſie: for he would ask advice of none of them, but would be obeyed by them all: and if Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would ſend none of their Prelates thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would hold a Council without them, and would let the World ſee what a <hi>Pope,</hi> that had courage, could do. This impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious humour of his, made him talk ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like a mad man: He intended, as was believed, to raiſe his Nephew to be King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and in order to that, he ſent one of his Nephews to <hi>France,</hi> to abſolve the King from the Truce which he had ſworn: and promiſed to create what Cardinals that King would nominate, if he would make War on <hi>Spain;</hi> though to the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, and all others at <hi>Rome,</hi> he gave it out, that he would mediate a Peace between the Crowns, for a Truce did not ſufficiently ſecure the quiet of <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King was too eaſily perſwaded by the Inſtigation of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Guize,</hi> to break his Faith, and begin the War. The <hi>Pope</hi> alſo began it in <hi>Italy,</hi> and put the Cardinals of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faction in Priſon, and threatned to proceed to Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures againſt King <hi>Philip,</hi> for protecting the <hi>Colonneſi,</hi> who were his particular Enemies. He made ſome Levies among the <hi>Griſons,</hi> that were Hereticks; but ſaid, he lookt on 'em as Angels of God, and was confident,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:170737:332"/>God would convert them. The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had that Reverence for the Papacy, that he took Arms againſt the <hi>Pope</hi> very unwillingly: He could have taken <hi>Rome,</hi> but would not: and for the places that he took, he declared he would deliver them up to the next <hi>Pope.</hi> It gave great ſcandal to the World, to ſee the <hi>Pope</hi> ſet on ſo perfidious a breach of Truce; and it was thought ſtrange, that in the ſame Year, a Great Prince in the 56. Year of his Age, ſhould retire to a Monaſtery; and that one bred a Monk, and 80. Years old, ſhould ſet <hi>Europe</hi> in a Flame.</p>

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:170737:333"/>dead Bodies, with many Heretical Books were all burnt in one Fire. <hi>Peru</hi> was Vice-Chancellour at this time, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be in ſome Office four years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when, by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Order, publick honours were done to the Memory of theſe Learned Men, and he obeyed both theſe Orders with ſo much zeal, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared how exactly he had learned the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo much ſtudied in that Age, of ſerving the time.

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:170737:333"/>They managed their Proceſſes in ſecret, and put their Priſoners to ſuch ſorts of Torture, as they thought fit for extorting Confeſſions or Diſcoveries from them.

The Lord <hi>Stourton</hi> was a zealous Papiſt, and had proteſted againſt all the Acts that had paſt in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time; yet the Queen not only would not pardon him, but would not ſo much as change the Infamous death of hanging, into a beheading: not becauſe the Prerogative extends not ſo far, as ſome have without

All the diſtinction was, that the Lord <hi>Stourton</hi> was hanged in a ſilken Rope.

                  </note> King <hi>Philip</hi> had a great mind to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage <hi>England</hi> in it. The Queen complained often of the kind reception that was given to the fugitives, that fled from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> and it was believed that the <hi>French</hi> ſecretly ſupplied and encouraged them to imbroil her affairs. One <hi>Stafford</hi> had this Year gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many of them together, and landing in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> he ſurpriſed the Caſtle of <hi>Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> and publiſhed a Manifeſto againſt the Queen, that by bringing in ſtrangers to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Nation, ſhe had forfeited her right to the Crown: but few came in to him; ſo he and his Complices were forced to render, and four of them were hanged. The <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Ambaſſadour in <hi>France,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> diſcovered that the Conſtable had a deſign to take <hi>Calais:</hi> for he ſent his own Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, whom he had brought over, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed ſecretly, to him, he pretended he was ſent from a great Party in that Town,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:170737:335"/>who were reſolved to deliver it up: at which the Conſtable ſeemed not a little glad, and entred into a long diſcourſe with him of the Methods of taking it: yet all this made no great Impreſſion on the Queen; All her Council, chiefly the Clergy, were againſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging; for they ſaw that would oblige them to ſlacken their ſeverities at home: ſo the King found it neceſſary to come over himſelf, and perſwade her to it. He prevailed with her: and after a denunciation of War, ſhe ſent over 80000.

                  </note> but when the two Armies were in view of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>French</hi> by a miſtake in the word of command, fell in diſorder; upon which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> charged them with ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that the whole Army was defeated: Many were killed on the place, and many were taken Priſoners, among whom was the Conſtable himſelf: and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> loſt only fifty Men. Had <hi>Philip</hi> followed this blow, and marched ſtraight to <hi>Paris,</hi> he had found all <hi>France</hi> in a great conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but he ſat ſtill before S. <hi>Quintin,</hi> which held out till the terror of this defeat was much over.

               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Troops were called out of <hi>Italy,</hi> upon which the <hi>Pope</hi> being now expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> fell in ſtrange fits of rage;
<note place="margin">The <hi>Pope</hi> recalls <hi>Pool.</hi>
                  </note> particularly he inveighed much againſt <hi>Pool,</hi> for ſuffering the Queen to joyn with the Enemies of the Apoſtolick See: and having made a General Decree, recalling all his Legates and Nuntio's in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions, he recalled <hi>Pool</hi>'s Legatine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer among the reſt: and neither the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of the Queen's Ambaſſadours, nor the other Cardinals could prevail with him to alter it: only as an extraordinary Grace, he conſented not to intimate it to him. But after this he went further: He made Friar <hi>Peyto</hi> a Cardinal: he liked him for his rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt King <hi>Henry</hi> to his Face, and thought that ſince the Queen had made him her Confeſſor, he would be very acceptable to her. He recalled <hi>Pool</hi>'s powers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and anſwer to ſome Complaints made of him, for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he ſhewed to Hereticks: He alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>Peyto</hi> his Legate for <hi>England,</hi> and writ to the Queen to receive him: but the Queen ordered the Bulls and Briefs that were ſent over, to be laid up without open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, which had been the method for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly practiſed, when unacceptable Bulls were ſent over: She ſent word to <hi>Peyto,</hi> not to come into <hi>England,</hi> otherwiſe ſhe would ſue him, and all that owned him, in a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire.</hi> He died ſoon after. Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> laid aſide the Enſigns of a Legate, and ſent over <hi>Ormaneto</hi> with ſo ſubmiſſive a
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170737:336"/>Meſſage, that the <hi>Pope</hi> was much mollified by it, and a Treaty of Peace being ſet on foot, this ſtorm went over. The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> marched near <hi>Rome,</hi> which was in no condition to reſiſt him: ſo the <hi>Pope</hi> in great fury called the Cardinals together, and told them, he was reſolved to ſuffer Martyrdom, without being daunted, which they who knew that he had drawn all this on himſelf, by his Ambition and Rage, could ſcarce hear without laughter. Yet the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was willing to treat. The haughty <hi>Pope,</hi> though he was forced to yield in the chief points, yet in the punctilio's of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, he ſtood ſo high upon his honour, which he ſaid was Chriſt's honour, that he declared he would ſee the whole World ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, rather than yield in a Title: In that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was willing enough to comply with him, ſo he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and in his Maſter's name, asked pardon for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the Patrimony of <hi>S. Peter;</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> gave him Abſolution, in as Inſolent a manner, as if he had been the Conqueror. The news of this Reconciliation were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in <hi>England,</hi> with all the publickeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of joy. In <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> Regent ſtudied to engage that Nation in the War: all that favoured the Reformation were for it; but the Clergy oppoſed it. The <hi>Queen</hi> thought to draw them into it, whether they would or not, and ſent in <hi>D'oiſell</hi> to beſiege a Caſtle in <hi>England.</hi> But the <hi>Scotch</hi> Lords complained much of that, and required him to give over his attempt, otherwiſe they
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:170737:337"/>would declare him an Enemy to the Nation. So after ſome ſlight skirmiſhes on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the matter was put up on both ſides. This made the <hi>Queen</hi> Regent write to <hi>France,</hi> preſſing them to conclude the Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Dolphin</hi> and the Queen: upon which a Meſſage was ſent from that Court, deſiring the <hi>Scots</hi> to ſend over Commiſſioners to treat about the Articles of the Marriage, and ſome of every State were diſpatched for ſetling that matter. There was this Year great want of Money in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer of <hi>England;</hi> and the backwardneſs of the laſt Parliament made the Council un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to call a new one. It was tried what Sums could be raiſed by Loan, upon Privy Seals: but ſo little came in that way, that at laſt one was Summoned to meet in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> yet in the mean while advertiſements were given them, of the ill condition, in which the Garriſons of <hi>Calais,</hi> and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring places were, and that the <hi>French</hi> had a deſign on them: but either they thought there was no danger during the Winter, or they wanted Money ſo much, that no care was taken to ſecure them.</p>

                  </note> the Papiſts did this Year blow up the differences between the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> and the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> with ſo much Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, that a Conference, which was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ſetling matters of Religion, was broken up, without any good effect: Only it diſcovered a common practice of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh party, in engaging thoſe that divided
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:170737:337"/>from them, into heats and animoſities one againſt another, by which their ſtrength was not only much weakned, but their Zeal, inſtead of turning againſt the Common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, turned upon one another. But yet the many Experiments that have been made of this, have not been able to infuſe that moderation and prudence in many of the Reformed Churches, which might have been expected. In <hi>France,</hi> the numbers of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed increaſed ſo much, that 200. aſſembled in St. <hi>Germains,</hi> one of the Suburbs of <hi>Paris,</hi> to receive the Communion. This was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the People of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and a Tumult was raiſed: the Men for moſt eſcaped, but 160. Women, and ſome few Men were taken: of theſe ſix Men and one Woman were burnt: and moſt horrid things were publiſhed of that Meeting; and among other Calumnies, it was ſaid, they ſacrificed and eat a Child. All theſe were confuted in an Apology, Printed for their Vindication: The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Princes, and the <hi>Cantons</hi> interpoſed ſo effectually, and their Alliance was then ſo neceſſary to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> that a ſtop was put to further ſeverities. The <hi>Pope</hi> complained much of that, and of ſome Edicts that the King had ſet out, annulling Marriages without conſent of Parents, and requiring Churchmen to reſide at their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, as Invaſions on the Spiritual Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>

The Lords deſired a Conference with the Commons, concerning the ſafety of the Nation, and upon that a Subſidy, a Tenth, and a Fifteenth were given by the Laity, and the Clergy gave eight ſhillings in the Pound, to be payed in four Years. The Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> moved, that the Priviledges of Sanctuary might be again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his Houſe; but that was laid aſide. The procurers of wilful Murder were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the benefit of the Clergy: but great oppoſition was made to it in the Houſe of Lords. A Bill was brought in, confirming the Letters Patents, which the Queen had granted, or might grant. This related to the Foundations of Religious Houſes, but one <hi>Coxley</hi> oppoſed this; and inſinuated, that perhaps the Queen intended to diſpoſe of the Crown, in prejudice of the right Heir: at which the Houſe expreſſed ſo great a diſlike, as ſhewed, they would not have it ſo much, as imagined, that Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> could be excluded. He had a publick reprimend given him for inſinuating a thing ſo much to the Queen's diſhonour.</p>
               <p>A Propoſition of Marriage,
<note place="margin">The carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and uſage of Lady <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> all this Reign.</note> was at this time privately made by the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to Lady <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but ſhe rejected it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not ſent to her by the Queen:
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170737:340"/>though the Meſſenger declared that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as he was a Gentleman, began at her, and as he was a King, he had ordered him to propoſe it next to the Queen. But ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him, that if the Queen would leave her to her ſelf, ſhe would not change her ſtate of life. When the Queen knew of this, ſhe approved much of her Siſter's anſwer, and ſent one to her to try her mind in it; for now the Propoſition was made to her: but ſhe expreſſed her diſlike of a married ſtate ſo firmly, that this motion fell to the ground. It ſeems her averſion was very great, otherwiſe the condition ſhe was then in, was neither ſo eaſie, nor ſo ſecure, but that ſhe had reaſon to deſire to be out of her Keeper's hands; and to apprehend that her danger encreaſed, as the Queen's health was impaired: for many of the Biſhops were offering Cruel counſels againſt Her. She had been firſt ſent for upon the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Wiat</hi>'s Conſpiracy: and though ſhe lay then ſick in Bed, ſhe was forc'd to come to <hi>Court:</hi> There ſhe was at firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to her Lodgings, and was afterwards carried to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and led into it by the <hi>Traytor</hi>'s Gate, and was ſtrictly guarded: Her Servants were put from her, and none had acceſs to her, but thoſe that were Spies upon her: nor was ſhe ſuffered to walk on the Leads, or have the ordinary comforts of Air. Some were put to the Rack to draw Confeſſions from them, but none ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed her, except <hi>Wiat,</hi> and he retracted what he had ſaid in hopes of a Pardon,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:170737:340"/>when he was upon the <hi>Scaffold.</hi> When it appeared that nothing could be made out againſt her, ſhe was ſent down to <hi>Woodſtock:</hi> and was kept under ſtrict Guards, and very roughly uſed by Sir <hi>Henry Benefield.</hi> But King <hi>Philip</hi> ſo far mollified the Queen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, that he prevailed with her to bring her to <hi>Court;</hi> and to admit her to her Preſence. <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and many others dealt much with her, to confeſs her offences, and ask the Queen's pardon: but ſhe always ſtood upon her Innocence, and ſaid ſhe had never offended her, not ſo much as in her thoughts. When ſhe was brought to the Queen, ſhe renewed the ſame proteſtations to her, and begged that ſhe would enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a good opinion of her. The Queen, though ſhe preſſed her much to acknowledg ſome faultineſs, yet ſeemed to be ſatisfied with what ſhe ſaid; and parted with her in good terms: of which King <hi>Philip</hi> had ſome apprehenſions, for he had conveyed himſelf ſecretly into a corner of the Room, that he might prevent a further breach, in caſe the Queen ſhould fall into heats with her. After this her Guards were diſcharged, and ſhe ſeemed to be at liberty: but ſhe had ſo many Spies about her, that to avoid all ſuſpicion, ſhe medled in no ſort of buſineſs; but gave her ſelf wholly to ſtudy: Thus was ſhe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for five years, during which time, ſhe was under continual apprehenſions of Death, which was perhaps a neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for that long courſe of Proſperity and Glory, with which ſhe was afterwards bleſt.</p>

Six were burnt at <hi>Brainford,</hi> in <hi>July:</hi> a Miniſter was burnt at <hi>Norwich,</hi> in that Month: In <hi>Auguſt,</hi> a Gentleman was burnt near <hi>Wincheſter:</hi> At St. <hi>Edmondſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> four were burnt in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and three more in <hi>November:</hi> at the ſame time, a Man and a Woman were burnt at <hi>Ipſwich:</hi> a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was alſo burnt at <hi>Exeter;</hi> and on the 10th. of <hi>November,</hi> three Men and two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were burnt at <hi>Canterbury;</hi> in all XXXIX.

At firſt pardons were offered at the Stake, to tempt the Martyrs to the laſt moment of their life; but afterwards the <hi>Prieſts</hi> Cruelty, as it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to the laſt Week of the Queens life, ſo it encreaſed to that degree, that <hi>Bembridge,</hi> who was burnt near <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, when he felt the Violence of the fire, that he recanted; the Sheriff made his People put out the Fire, and hoped, that ſince the Clergy pretended, that they deſired the Converſion, and not the deſtruction of the Hereticks, this act of Mercy would not diſpleaſe them: but the Council writ to him, ordering him to go on and execute the Sentence, and to take care that he ſhould dye a good Catholick; for it was ſaid, if he recanted ſincerely, he was fit to dye; and if he did it not ſincerely, he was not fit to live: and when this was done, the Sheriff was put in the <hi>Fleet</hi> for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>

Hail-ſtones of a huge bigneſs fell in ſome places. Intermitting Fevers were ſo Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and Contagious, that they raged like a Plague, ſo that in many Places there were not People enough to reap the Harveſt: all which tended to encreaſe the averſion to the Government, and that diſpoſed the Queen to hearken to overtures of Peace. This was projected between the Biſhop of <hi>Arras,</hi> and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who were the chief Favourites to the two Kings, and were both much ſet on extirpating He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, which could not be done, during the continuance of the War; the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was more earneſt in it, becauſe the Conſtable, who was the Head of the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, againſt the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> was ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to favour it, and his three Nephews, the <hi>Coligny</hi>'s, were known to encline to it: The King of <hi>France</hi> had alſo loſt another Battel, this Year, at <hi>Gravelin,</hi> which made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a Peace: for he thought the driving the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> did compenſate both that, and his loſs at St. <hi>Quintin:</hi> So both thoſe Princes reckoned they had ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, that they might make Peace with honour: and they being thus diſpoſed to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:170737:342"/>it, a Treaty was opened at <hi>Cambray. Philip,</hi> in his own diſpoſition, was much inclined to extirpate Hereſie, and the Brothers of <hi>Guiſe</hi> poſſeſſed the King of <hi>France</hi> with the ſame Maximes: which ſeemed more neceſſary, becauſe Hereſie had then ſpread ſo much in that Court, that both the King and Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> declared themſelves for the Reformation: and great numbers in the Publick Walks about <hi>Paris,</hi> uſed to aſſemble at Nights, and ſing <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms in Verſe. The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> was the firſt Prince of the Blood, and ſo was in great conſideration for his rank, but was a weak Man: His Queen was the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of her Age, both for great Parts, Eminent Vertues, and a moſt Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſenſe of Religion. There was an Edict ſet out, forbiding this Pſalmody, but the dignity of theſe crowned Heads, and the Numbers of thoſe that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it, made it ſeem not adviſable to puniſh any for it, at leaſt, till a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Peace had been firſt made.</p>
               <p>In <hi>April</hi> was the <hi>Dauphin</hi> married to the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> and Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> married.</note> which was honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by an Epithalamium, writ by <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> reckoned to be one of the rareſt Pieces of <hi>Latine</hi> Poetry.

It was generally ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that they were poiſoned: when the reſt returned to <hi>Scotland,</hi> an Aſſembly of the States was called, in which it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to allow the <hi>Dauphin</hi> the Title of King, but with this Proviſo, that he ſhould have no power over them, and that it was only a bare Title, which they offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.

<note place="margin">The Queens Death.</note> which received a ſurcharge from the loſs of <hi>Calais,</hi> brought her into an ill habit of body, and that turned to a Dropſie, which put an end to her unhappy Reign, in the forty-third year of her Age, after ſhe had reigned five Years, four Months, and eleven Days. Sixteen hours after, her Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the fifty ninth year of his Age. He left <hi>Priuli</hi> a Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> that had lived twenty ſix years in an entire friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, his Executor: but as <hi>Pool</hi> had not ſtudied to heap up much Wealth, ſo <hi>Priuli,</hi> who had refuſed a Cardinal's Hat, rather than be obliged thereby to loſe his Company, gave it all away, and reſerved nothing to himſelf, but his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary and Diary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pool</hi> was a learned, humble,
<note place="margin">

And though his ſuperſtition for the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> continued ſtill with him, yet his Eyes were opened in many things: his being Legate at <hi>Trent,</hi> and his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Viterbo,</hi> had both enlightned and compoſed his mind; and that joyned to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:170737:344"/>the Probity and ſweetneſs of his Temper, produced great effects in him: his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter deſerves the more to be enlarged on, becauſe there were no others of the Clergy, at that time, concerning whom even a partial Hiſtorian can find much good to relate; for their temporiſing and diſſimulation, in the changes that were made, and their Cruelty, when power was put in their hands, were ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that it is ſcarce poſſible to write of them, with that ſoftneſs of ſtile, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an Hiſtorian.</p>
               <p>The Queen had been bred to ſome more than ordinary knowledge:
<note place="margin">The Queens Character.</note> A fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſort of Vertue, and a Melancholy Piety, are the beſt things that can be ſaid of her: ſhe left the Conduct of Affairs wholly in the hands of her Council, and gave her ſelf up to follow all the dictates and humours of the Clergy: and though ſhe eſteemed <hi>Pool</hi> beyond them all, yet ſhe imputed the moderateneſs of his Counſels, rather to his Temper, than to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and perhaps thought that the <hi>Pope,</hi> who preſſed all Princes to ſet up Courts of Inquiſition, for extirpating of Hereſie, was more likely to be Infallible than the Cardinal: and as Princes were required by the fourth Council in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> to extirpate Hereticks, under the pain of forfeiting their Dominions; ſo the <hi>Pope</hi> had ſet out a Decree this Year, by the advice of all his Cardinals, confirming all
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:170737:344"/>Canons againſt Hereticks, declaring that ſuch Princes, as fell into Hereſie, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by forfeit all their Rights, without any ſpecial ſentence, and that any that could, might ſeize on their Dominions. The Biſhops had alſo this to ſay for their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities, that by the Oath which they took at their Conſecrations, they were bound to <hi>perſecute Hereticks with all their might:</hi> ſo that the Principles of that Religion, working on ſowre and revengeful tempers, it was no wonder that Cruel Councils were more acceptable than moderate ones.</p>

The Queen deſired, that all the changes that ſhould be made, might be ſo managed, as to breed as little diviſion among her People, as was poſſible: She did not like the Title of <hi>Supream Head,</hi> as importing too great an Authority.

It was therefore propoſed, that the Queen ſhould on any terms make Peace with <hi>France;</hi> and encourage the Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that deſired a Reformation. The Clergy were generally hated for their Cruelty, and it
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170737:348"/>would be eaſie to bring them within the Statute of <hi>Praemunire:</hi> Care was alſo to be taken to expoſe the former Councellours, for the ill conduct of affairs in Qu. <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, and ſo to leſſen their credit. It was alſo propoſed to look well to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, both for the Peace and the Militia, and to the Univerſities. Some Learned Men were to be ordered, to conſider what alterations were fit to be made, and by what ſteps they ſhould proceed.</q> It was thought fit to begin with the Communion in both kinds.</p>
               <p>Now did the Exiles,
<note place="margin">The Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of ſome.</note> that had fled beyond Sea, return again; and ſome zealous People began, in many places, to break Images, and ſet up King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Service again. Upon this the Queen ordered, that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, and other parts of the Service ſhould be ſaid in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that no Elevation ſhould be uſed in the Maſs: but required her Subjects by Proclamation,
<note place="margin">27 <hi>Decemb.</hi>
                  </note> to avoid all Innovations, and uſe no other forms, but thoſe that ſhe kept up in her Chappel, till it ſhould be otherwiſe appointed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. She ordered her Siſter's Funeral to be performed with the ordinary Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: <hi>White,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> that Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Sermon, not only extolled her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment much, but made ſevere Reflections on the preſent ſtate of affairs; for which he was confined to his Houſe for ſome time.</p>
               <p>Many Sees were now vacant: So one of the firſt things that came under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:170737:348"/>was the finding out fit Men for them. Dr. <hi>Parker</hi> was pitched on, as the fitteſt for the See of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> He had been Chaplain to <hi>Anne Boleyn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Parker</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes the See of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> long.</note> and had been imployed in inſtructing the Queen, in the Points of Religion, when ſhe was young: He was well known to Sir <hi>Nicolas Bacon,</hi> and both he and <hi>Cecyl</hi> gave ſo high a Character of him, that it meeting with the <hi>Queen</hi>'s par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular eſteem, made them reſolve on advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him: but as ſoon as he knew it, he uſed all the Arguments he poſſibly could againſt it, both from the weakneſs of his Body, and his unfitneſs for ſo great a charge. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that he might be put in ſome ſmall Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice of 20. Nobles a Year; So far was he from aſpirings to great Wealth, or high Dignities: and as <hi>Cranmer</hi> had done before him, he continued for many Months ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to it, that it was very hard to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. Such Promotions are generally, if not greedily ſought after, yet at leaſt willingly enough undertaken: but this look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liker the practiſes in Ancient than Modern times. In the beſt Ages of the Church, inſtead of that Ambitus, which has given ſuch ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to the World in later times, it was ordinary for Men to flye from the offer of great Preferments, and to retire to a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, or a Monaſtery, rather than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a charge, which they thought above their Merit or Capacity to diſcharge. And this will ſtill ſhew it ſelf in all ſuch as have a juſt ſenſe of the Paſtoral care, and conſider the diſcharging that, more than the raiſing
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:170737:349"/>or enriching themſelves or their Families. And it was thought no ſmall honour to the Reformation, that the two chief Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that promoted it, <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> gave ſuch evidences of a Primitive Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in being ſo unwillingly advanced.</p>
               <p>The Seals were taken from <hi>Heath,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1559"/> and put in <hi>Bacon</hi>'s hands,

               <p>On the 13th.
<note place="margin">The <hi>Queen</hi> is Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> of <hi>January,</hi> the Queen was Crowned: When ſhe entred into her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot at the <hi>Tower,</hi> ſhe offered up an humble acknowledgment to God, for delivering her out of that Lions Den, and preſerving her to that Joyful Day. She paſſed through <hi>London</hi> in great Triumph, and received all the expreſſions of Joy from her People, with ſo much ſweetneſs, as gained as much on their Hearts, as her Siſters ſowrneſs had alienated them from her. Under one of the Triumphal Arches, a Child came down, as from Heaven, repreſenting <hi>Truth</hi> with a <hi>Bible</hi> in his hand, which ſhe received on her Knees, and kiſſed it, and ſaid, ſhe prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that above all the other Preſents that were that Day made her: She was Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:170737:349"/>by <hi>Oglethorp,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> for all the other Biſhops refuſed to aſſiſt at it; and he only could be prevailed on to do it. They perceived that ſhe intended to make changes in Religion, and though many of them had changed often before, yet they reſolved now to ſtick firmer to that which they had ſo lately profeſſed, and for which they had ſhed ſo much Blood.</p>
               <p>The Parliament was opened on the 25th.
<note place="margin">A Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called.</note> of <hi>January; Bacon</hi> made a long Speech, both concerning matters of Religion, and the State of the Nation. He deſired they would examine the former Religion, without heat or partial affection; and that all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches might be forborn, and extreams avoided: and that things might be ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that all might agree in an Uniformity in Divine Worſhip. He laid open the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the former Reign, and aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the loſs of <hi>Calais:</hi> but ſhewed, that it could not be eaſily recovered. He made a high Panegyrick of the Queen, but when he ſhewed the neceſſities ſhe was in, he ſaid, ſhe would deſire no ſupply, but what they ſhould freely and chearfully offer. The Houſe of Commons began at a Debate, Whether the want of the Title of <hi>Supream Head</hi> in the enumeration of the Queen's Titles, made a Nullity in the Writs, by which this and ſome former Parliaments had been ſummoned: but they concluded in the Negative.</p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:170737:350"/>
               <p>The Treaty at <hi>Cambray</hi> ſtuck chiefly at the reſtitution of <hi>Calais:</hi> and King <hi>Philip</hi> for a great while inſiſted ſo poſitively on it, that he refuſed to make Peace on other terms.
<note place="margin">The Peace at <hi>Cambray.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>England</hi> had loſt it by a War, in which they engaged on his account; ſo in honour he was bound to ſee to it. But when the hopes of his marrying the Queen vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and when he ſaw ſhe was going to make changes in Religion, he grew more careleſs of her Intereſts, and told the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Ambaſſadours, that unleſs they would enter into a League for keeping up the War ſix Years longer, he muſt ſubmit to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his affairs, and make Peace. So the Queen liſtned to Propoſitions ſent her from <hi>France.</hi> She complained of the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>'s aſſuming the Title and Arms of <hi>England:</hi> It was anſwered, that ſince ſhe carried the Title and Arms of <hi>France,</hi> ſhe had no reaſon to quarrel much on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. She ſaw ſhe could not make War with <hi>France</hi> alone, and knew that <hi>Philip</hi> had made a ſeparated Peace. She had no mind to begin her Reign with a War, that would probably be unſucceſsful, or demand Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that would be ſo grievous, as that thereby ſhe might loſe the affections of her People. The loſs of <hi>Calais</hi> was no reproach on her, but fell wholly on her Siſter's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: and ſince ſhe intended to make ſome changes in matters of Religion, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be at quiet with her Neighbours: Upon this, ſhe reſolved to make Peace with <hi>France,</hi> on the beſt terms that could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:170737:350"/>It was agreed, that at the end of eight Years, <hi>Calais</hi> ſhould either be reſtored, or 500000. Crowns ſhould be payed the Queen: yet if, during that time, ſhe made War, either on <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhe was to forfeit her right to <hi>Calais. Aymouth</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> was to be raſed, and all differences on the Borders there, were to be determined, by ſome deputed on both ſides; this being adjuſted, a General Peace between the Crowns of <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> was concluded: and thus the Queen being freed from the dangerous conſultations, that the continuance of a War might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved her in, was the more at liberty to ſettle matters at home.</p>
               <p>The firſt Bill,
<note place="margin">Acts paſt in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that was brought to try the Temper of the Parliament, was for the Reſtitution of the Tenths and Firſt-fruits to the Crown; againſt this, all the Biſhops proteſted, but that was all the oppoſition made to it. By it, not only that Tax was of new laid on the Clergy, but all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated Benefices, which Queen <hi>Mary</hi> had ſurrendred, were reſtored to the Crown.</p>
               <p>After this,
<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons pray the Queen to marry.</note> the Commons made an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the Queen, deſiring her to chooſe ſuch a Husband, as might make both her ſelf, and the Nation happy. She received this very kindly, ſince they had neither li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited her to time, nor Nation: but decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that as hitherto ſhe had lived with great ſatisfaction in a ſingle ſtate, and had
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:170737:351"/>refuſed the Propoſitions that had been made her, both in her Brothers and Siſters reign, ſo ſhe had no Inclination to change her courſe of life. If ever ſhe did it, ſhe would take care, that it ſhould be for the good, and to the ſatisfaction of her People. She thought ſhe was married to the Nation at her Coronation, and looked on her People, as her Children; and ſhe would be well contented, if her Tombſtone might tell Poſterity, <hi>Here lies a Queen that reigned ſo long, and lived and dyed a Virgin.</hi> There was little more progreſs made in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſave, that a Committee was appointed by both Houſes, to conſider what ſhould be the Authority of the Perſon, whom the Queen might happen to marry; but ſhe ſent them a Meſſage, to proceed to other affairs, and let that alone.</p>
               <p>A Bill for the Recognition of her Title to the Crown was put in:
<note place="margin">Her Title to the Crown ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> It was not thought neceſſary to Repeal the Sentence of her Mothers Divorce, for the Crown purged all defects: and it was thought need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to look back unto a thing, which could not be done, without at leaſt caſting ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach on her Father; ſo it was in general words Enacted, <q rend="inline">That they did aſſuredly believe and declare, that by the Laws of God, and the Realm, ſhe was their lawful Queen, and was rightly and lineally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended.</q> This was thought a much wiſer way, than if they examined the Sentence of Divorce, that paſt, upon the Confeſſion
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:170737:351"/>of a Precontract, which muſt have revived the remembrance of things that were better left in ſilence.</p>
               <p>Bills were put in for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Service,
<note place="margin">Acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion.</note> for reviving King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws, and for annexing the Supremacy again to the Crown. To that, concerning the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, two Temporal Lords, and nine Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, with the Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. It was propoſed to revive the Law, for making the Biſhops by Letters-Patents, as was in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, but they chooſed rather to revive the Act for Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, made in the 25. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. They revived all Acts made againſt the <hi>Pope</hi>'s power, in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s time, and repealed thoſe, made by Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted an Oath, for acknowledging the Queen <hi>Supream Governour in all cauſes, and over all Perſons:</hi> Thoſe that refuſed it, were to forfeit all Offices that they held, either in Church or State, and to be under a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, during life. If any ſhould advance the authority of a Foreign Power; for the firſt offence, they were to be fined, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned; for the ſecond, to be in a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire;</hi> and the third was made <hi>Treaſon:</hi> The Queen was alſo impowered to give Commiſſions, for Judging and Reforming Eccleſiaſtical matters; who were limited to judge nothing to be Hereſie, but what had been already ſo judged by the authority of the Scriptures, or the firſt four General Councils. All Points that were not deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:170737:352"/>either by expreſs words of Scripture, or by thoſe Councils, were to be referred to the Parliament and Convocation. The Title of <hi>Supream Head</hi> was changed, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the <hi>Queen</hi> had ſome ſcruples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and partly to moderate the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which the Popiſh party might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe make to it: and the refuſing the Oath was made no other way Penal, but that all Offices or Benefices were forfeited upon it, which was a great mitigation of the ſeverity in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s time. The Biſhops are ſaid to have made ſeveral Speeches againſt this, in the Houſe of Lords: but that which goes under the name of <hi>Heath</hi>'s Speech muſt be a forgery; for in it the Supremacy is called a new and unheard of thing, which could not have flowed from one that had ſworn it ſo often, both under King <hi>Henry,</hi> and King <hi>Edward. Tonſtall</hi> came not to this Parliament, and he was ſo offended with the Cruelties of the laſt Reign, that he had withdrawn himſelf into his Dioceſs: where he burnt none himſelf, upon that it was now thought, that he was ſo much alienated from thoſe Methods, that ſome had great hopes of his declaring for the Reformation. <hi>Heath</hi> had been likewiſe very moderate, nor were any burnt under him. Upon the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer given the <hi>Queen,</hi> to appoint ſome to Reform and direct all Eccleſiaſtical matters, was the Court, called the <hi>High Commiſſion Court,</hi> founded: which indeed was nothing, but the ſharing that authority, which was in one Perſon in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s time, into
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:170737:352"/>many hands: for that Court had no other authority, but that which was lodged for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in <hi>Cromwell,</hi> as the King's Vicegerent, and was now thought too great to be truſted to one Man.</p>
               <p>Great complaints were made of ſeditious Sermons, preached by the Popiſh Clergy:
<note place="margin">Preaching without Licence forbidden.</note> upon which, the <hi>Queen</hi> followed the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that her Siſter had made, and forbid all Preaching, excepting only by ſuch, as obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Licence under the Great Seal for it: She likewiſe ſent an Order to the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, requiring them, under the pains of a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> to make no Canons. Yet the lower Houſe, in an Addreſs to the upper Houſe, declared for the Corporal Preſence, and that the Maſs was a Propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and for the Supremacy, and that matters of Religion fell only under the Cogniſance of the Paſtors of the Church. The greateſt part of both Univerſities had alſo ſet their hands to all theſe Points, except the laſt.</p>
               <p>This, it ſeems,
<note place="margin">A publick Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> was the rather added by the Clerks of Convocation, to hinder a publick Conference, which the <hi>Queen</hi> had appointed, between the Biſhops and the Reformed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. It was firſt propoſed to <hi>Heath,</hi> who was ſtill a Privy Councellour, and he, after ſome Conference about it, with his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, accepted of it. Nine of a ſide were to diſpute about three Points: Worſhip in an Unknown Tongue, the power that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Church had to alter Rites and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:170737:353"/>Ceremonies, and the Maſſe's being a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Sacrifice, for the Dead and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: All was to be given in in Writing: The Biſhops were to begin in every Point, and they were to interchange their Papers, and anſwer them. The laſt of <hi>March</hi> was the firſt day of Conference, which held in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abby, in the preſence of the Privy Council, and both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> pretended, there had been ſome miſtake in the Order, and that their Paper was not quite finiſhed: but that Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> ſhould deliver in diſcourſe what they had prepared, though it was not yet in that order, that it could be Copied out. The ſecret of this was, The Biſhops had reſolved openly to Vindicate their Doctrine, but not to give any Papers, or enter into diſpute with Hereticks, or ſo far to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Queen's Supremacy, as to engage in Conferences, at her command. <hi>Cole</hi> was obſerved to read almoſt all he ſaid, though he affected to be thought only to deliver a diſcourſe ſo, as if moſt part of it had been Extemporary.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of it was,
<note place="margin" type="runSum">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for &amp; againſt the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in an unknown Tongue.</note> that though the Worſhip in a known Tongue had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Scriptures, yet the Church had power to change it, as ſhe changed the Sabbath, and had appointed the Sacrament to be received faſting, though it was Inſtituted after Supper: to eat blood was forbid, and a Community of goods was ſet up by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; yet it was in the power of the Church to
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:170737:353"/>alter theſe things; he enlarged on the evil of Schiſm, and the neceſſity of adhering to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Vulgar Tongues chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged daily, but the <hi>Latine</hi> was the ſame, &amp; was ſpread over many Countries. The People might reap profit from Prayers, which they underſtood not, as well as abſent Perſons. The Queen of <hi>Ethiopia</hi>'s Eunuch read <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> though he underſtood him not; and <hi>Philip</hi> was ſent to explain that Prophecy to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Horn,</hi> when this was ended, read the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per drawn by the Reformers; he began it with a Prayer, and a Proteſtation of their ſincerity. They founded their Aſſertion on Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> in which he enjoyned them to pray with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that ſo the Unlearned might ſay, <hi>Amen;</hi> and that nothing ſhould be ſpoken, that might give an uncertain ſound, but that all things ſhould be done to edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and though the ſpeaking with ſtrange Tongues, was then an extraordinary gift of the Holy Ghoſt, yet he forbids the uſing it, where there was not an Interpreter. Things ſo expreſly enjoyned could not be indifferent, or fall under the power of the Church. The <hi>Jews</hi> had their Worſhip in the Vulgar Tongue, ſo had alſo the moſt barbarous Nations, when converted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. The natural uſe of Speech was, that every thing which was ſaid, might be underſtood: Quotations were brought, to ſhew that Pſalms were daily ſung in the Vulgar Tongue among all Nations.</p>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:170737:354"/>
               <p>When they ended their Paper, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with a ſhout of applauſe; and was put in the Lord Keeper's hands, ſigned by them all. But the Biſhops refuſed to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theirs. The next day was appointed for conſidering the ſecond Point, but the Biſhops reſolved to go no further in the Conference; for they ſaw by the applauſe of the People, that the Audience was more favourable to the other ſide: ſo the next day of Meeting, they offered an anſwer to the Paper given in the former day by the Reformers. The Lord Keeper told them, that according to the Order laid down, they were firſt to go through the three Points, before they might be ſuffered to reply: but they ſaid, <hi>Cole</hi> had the former day only gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his own ſenſe in an Extemporary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Their foul dealing in this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the whole Audience, ſo the Lord Keeper required them to go to the ſecond Point: but they refuſed to begin, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the other ſide ſhould be made to begin; and though the Lord Keeper ſhewed them, that this was contrary to the Order agreed on before-hand, yet they continued all reſolute, and would not proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Ferknam</hi> only excepted: but he ſaid, he could do nothing alone, ſince the reſt would not joyn with him. The Biſhops of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> and <hi>Lincoln</hi> ſaid, the Faith of the Church ought not to be examined, except in a Synod of Divines: and it gave too great an encouragement to Hereticks, to diſpute with them: and that both the <hi>Queen</hi>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:170737:354"/>and her Council deſerved to be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, for ſuffering them to argue againſt the Catholick Faith, before an Unlearned Multitude. Upon this, they were ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the Conference broke up: but the Reformers thought the advantage was much on their ſide, and that things were now carried much more fairly, than had been in thoſe Conferences and Diſputes, that were in the beginning of the former Reign. The Papiſts, on the other hand, ſaid, it was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the Audience was prepoſſeſſed, and that the Conference was appointed only to make way for the changes, that the Parliament was then about, with the Pomp of a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and therefore as they blamed the Biſhops, for undertaking it, ſo they juſtified them for breaking it off.</p>
               <p>The Book of Common-Prayer was now reviſed,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Service is again ſet up.</note> the moſt conſiderable alteration was, that the expreſs Declaration, which was made in the ſecond Book, ſet out by King <hi>Edward,</hi> againſt the Corporal Preſence, was left out, that ſo none might be driven out of the Communion of the Church, upon that account. The matter was left unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, as a ſpeculative Point, in which People were left at liberty. The Book of Ordination was not ſpecially mentioned in the Act, which gave occaſion to <hi>Bonner</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, to queſtion the Legality of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations made by it. But it had been made a part of the Common-Prayer-Book in the 5th. year of King <hi>Edward;</hi> and the whole
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:170737:355"/>Book, then ſet out, was now confirmed: ſo that by a ſpecial Act made ſome years after this, it was declared, that that Office was underſtood to be a part of it.</p>
               <p>When the Bill for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Service was put in to the Houſe of Lords,
<note place="margin">Speeches made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it by ſome Biſhops.</note> 
                  <hi>Heath,</hi> and <hi>Scot</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Ferknam,</hi> made long Speeches againſt it, grounded chiefly on the Authority of the Church, the Antiquity of the eſtabliſhed Religion, and Novelty of the other; which was changed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, as appeared in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time. They ſaid, the conſent of the Catholick Church, and the perpetual ſucceſſion in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, ought to have more authe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than a few Preachers riſen up of late. They alſo enlarged much againſt the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the robbing of Churches, and the breaking of Images, that had been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Reformers, and thoſe that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured them. What was ſaid in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this in the Houſe of Lords, is not known, but a great deal of it may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the Paper which the Reformed Divines drew upon the ſecond Point, about which they were appointed to diſpute, of the power that every Church had to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it ſelf. This they founded on the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the particular Churches, and St. <hi>John</hi>'s to the Angels of the ſeven Churches. In the firſt three Ages there were no General Councils, but every Biſhop in his Dioceſs, or ſuch few Biſhops as could Aſſemble together, condemned Hereſies, or
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:170737:355"/>determined matters that were conteſted; ſo did alſo the Orthodox Biſhops, after <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm</hi> had ſo over-ſpread the World, that even the See of <hi>Rome</hi> was defiled with it. And abuſes were condemned in many places without ſtaying for a general concurrence: though that was then more poſſible, when all was under one Emperour, than it was at preſent. Even in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, many ſuperſtitions, as Pilgrimages, &amp; the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Reliques were laid aſide. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they concluded, that the Queen might by her own authority, reform even the Clergy, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſias</hi> had done under the old Law. When the Act paſt in the Houſe of Lords, eight Spiritual Lords, and nine Temporal Lords, proteſted againſt it; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom was the Marqueſs of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> Lord Treaſurer. Another Act paſt with more oppoſition, that the Queen might reſerve ſome Lands belonging to Biſhopricks to her ſelf, as they fell void, giving in lieu of them improprietated Tithes to the value of them: but this was much oppoſed in the Houſe of Commons, who apprehended, that under this pretence, there might new ſpoils be made of Church-lands, ſo that upon a Diviſion of the Houſe 90. were againſt it, but 133. were for it, and ſo it was paſt. All Religious Houſes founded by the late Queen, were ſuppreſt and united to the Crown. The deprivation of the Popiſh Biſhops in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red valid in Law, by which all the Leaſes which had been made by thoſe that were
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:170737:356"/>put in their Sees, were good in Law: A Subſidy, and two Tenths, and two Fifteenths, with the Bill of Tonnage and Poundage, were given, and ſo the Parliament was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, on the 8th. of <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Bills were propoſed, but not paſt; one was for reſtoring the Biſhops deprived by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who were <hi>Barlow, Scory</hi> and <hi>Coverdale:</hi> but the firſt of theſe had been made to reſign, and the laſt being extream old, reſolved to follow <hi>Latimer</hi>'s example, and not return to his See. So it was not thought worth the while to make an Act for <hi>Scory</hi> alone. Another Bill, that was laid aſide, was, for reſtoring all Churchmen to their Benefices, that had been turned Out, becauſe they were married: but it ſeems, it was not thought decent enough to begin with ſuch an Act. Another Bill that came to nothing, was, for impowering XXXII. Perſons to reviſe the Eccleſiaſtical Laws; but as this laſt was then let fall, ſo to the great prejudice of this Church, it has ſlept ever ſince.</p>
               <p>After the Parliament was diſſolved,
<note place="margin">Many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out.</note> the Oath of Supremacy was tendred to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and all, except <hi>Kitchin,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Landaffe,</hi> refuſed it. <hi>Tonſtall</hi> continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved till <hi>September,</hi> and ſo long did the Queen delay the putting it to him: But at laſt he refuſed it, and ſo loſt his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick. It was generally believed that be quitted it, rather becauſe being extream
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:170737:356"/>old, he thought it indecent to forſake his Brethren, and to be ſtill changing, than out of any ſcruple he had in his Conſcience, concerning it. All the Biſhops were at firſt put under confinement, but they were ſoon after ſet at liberty: only <hi>Bonner, White</hi> and <hi>Watſon,</hi> were kept Priſoners. Many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were brought againſt <hi>Bonner,</hi> for the Cruelties he had been guilty of againſt Law, and the Tortures he had put his Priſoners to himſelf: but yet the Queen reſolved not to ſtain the beginnings of her Reign with blood, and the Reformed Divines were, in imitation of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> upon the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; exhorting their Followers, not to think of revenging themſelves, but to leave that to God. <hi>Heath</hi> lived privately at his own Houſe, in which he was ſometimes viſited by the Queen. <hi>Tonſtall</hi> and <hi>Thirleby</hi> were appointed to live in <hi>Lambeth,</hi> with the new Archbiſhop. <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Watſon</hi> were moroſe, and haughty Men, much addicted to the School Divinity, which has been often obſerved, to incline People to an overvaluing of themſelvs. All the other Biſhops, except <hi>Pates, Scot</hi> and <hi>Goldwell,</hi> that had been Biſhops of <hi>Worceſter, Cheſter,</hi> and St. <hi>Aſaph,</hi> continued ſtill in <hi>England:</hi> but theſe had leave to go beyond Sea. A few Gentlemen, and all the Nuns went likewiſe out of <hi>England;</hi> and ſo gentle was the Queen, that ſhe denied that Liberty to none that asked it.</p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:170737:357"/>
               <p>The Queen inclined to keep Images ſtill in Churches, and though the Reformed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines made many applications, to divert her from it;
<note place="margin">The <hi>Queen</hi> inclined to keep Images in Churches.</note> yet ſhe was not eaſily wrought on. The Divines put all their Reaſons againſt them in Writing, and deſired her to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the determining of that matter, to a Synod of Biſhops and Divines, and not to take up an unalterable reſolution upon Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Conſiderations. They laid before her the ſecond Commandment againſt making Images for God, and the Curſe pronounced againſt thoſe that made an Image, and put it in a <hi>ſecret place,</hi> that is, in an Oratory: The Book of Wiſdom calls them <hi>a ſnare for the feet of the Ignorant, S. John</hi> charged the Chriſtians to <hi>beware of Idols,</hi> and not only of worſhipping them. The uſe of them fed ſuperſtition, and ended in Idolatry, and would breed great Diviſions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They ſhewed that Images were not allowed in the Church, till the 7th. Century, and the Conteſts that were raiſed about them, in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empire, occaſioned ſuch diſtractions, as in a great meaſure made way for its ruine, and laid it open to the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> Thefe things wrought ſo much on the Queen, that ſhe was at laſt content they ſhould be put down.</p>
               <p>It was now reſolved to ſend Viſiters over <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A General Viſitation.</note> ſo Injunctions were prepared for them. Thoſe appointed in the firſt year of King <hi>Edward,</hi> were now renewed with ſome
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:170737:357"/>little alteration: To which, <q rend="inline">Rules were added concerning the Marriages of the Clergy, for avoiding the ſcandals given by them. The Clergy were alſo required to uſe Habits, according to their degrees in the Univerſities. All People were to reſort to their own Pariſh Church; and ſome were to be appointed to examine and give notice of thoſe who went not to Church: all ſlanderous words were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. No Books were to be Printed without Licence: Inquiry was ordered to be made into all the proceedings againſt Hereticks, during the late Reign: Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was to be expreſſed, when the name <hi>Jeſus</hi> was pronounced: An Explanation was made of the ſupremacy, that the Queen did not pretend to any authority for Miniſtring Divine Service; but only that ſhe had the ſoveraignty over all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that no foreign Power was to be acknowledged: and ſuch as had ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples about it, might declare, that they took it only in that ſenſe. A Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Table was to be ſet, where the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars ſtood formerly, but on Sacrament Days, it was to be brought into the moſt convenient place in the Chancel. The Bread for the Sacrament was to have no figure on it, and to be thicker than Wafers. The bidding Prayer was appointed to be the ſame, that had been uſed in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, only an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that imported a Prayer for the Dead, was changed.</q> The obliging Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:170737:358"/>to go always in their Habits, was thought a good mean to make them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Decencies of their Function, when their Habit declared what they were, and would be a reproach to them, if they behaved themſelves unſutably to it. The bowing at the name <hi>Jeſus</hi> was conſidered, as ſuch an acknowledgment of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as was made by ſtanding up at the Creed, or the <hi>Gloria Patri.</hi> The liberty given to explain in what ſenſe the Oath of Supremacy was taken, gave a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the Moderation of the Queen's Government; that ſhe would not lay ſnares for her People, which is always a ſign of a wicked and Tyrannical Prince. But the Queen reckoned, that if ſuch Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Methods could be found out, as would once bring her People under an Union, though perhaps there might remain a great diverſity of Opinion, that would wear off with the preſent Age, and in the next Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration all would be of one mind. And this had the good effect that was expected from it, till the <hi>Pope</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> began to open Seminaries beyond Sea, for a Miſſion to <hi>England;</hi> which have ſince that time been the occaſion of almoſt all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions this Nation has laboured under.</p>
               <p>The Queen granted Commiſſions for the two Provinces of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The High-Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Courts.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting moſt of the Laity; ſome few of the Clergy being mixed with them: <q rend="inline">Impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to viſit the Churches, to ſuſpend
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:170737:358"/>or deprive unworthy Clergymen, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt ſcandalous Perſons, by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment or Church-cenſures; to reſerve Penſions for ſuch, as reſigned their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and to reſtore ſuch as had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully put out in the late Reign.</q> By theſe reſerved Penſions, as the Clergy that were turned out, were kept from extream want, ſo they were in great meaſure bound to their good behaviour by them: The Impowering Laymen to deprive Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or Excommunicate, could not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily excuſed, but was as juſtifiable, as the Commiſſions to Lay-chancellours for thoſe things were. There are 9400. Benefices in <hi>England,</hi> but of all theſe, the number of thoſe who choſe to reſign, rather than to take the Oath, was very inconſiderable. Fourteen Biſhops, ſix Abbots, twelve Deans, twelve Archdeacons, fifteen Heads of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, fifty Prebendaries, &amp; eighty Rectors, was the whole number of thoſe that were turned out. But it was believed, that the greateſt part complied againſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and would have been ready for another turn, if the Queen had died, while that Race of Incumbents lived, and the next Succeſſor had been of another Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>The See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was now to be filled: but <hi>Parker</hi> ſtood out long,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Parker</hi> is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly made Archbiſh. of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
                  </note> before he would ſubmit to a burden, which he thought diſproportioned to his ſtrength. He ſaid, he was afraid of incurring God's
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:170737:359"/>Indignation, for accepting a truſt which he could not diſcharge, as he ought, having neither ſtrength of body, nor mind, equal to it: he was threatned with Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in caſe of refuſal; but he ſaid, he would ſuffer it chearfully, rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a ſtation, that was ſo far above him: and he had ſuch a ſenſe of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal Function, that he reſolved never to aſpire to it. He thought he had but two or three years more of life before him, and deſired to imploy theſe well, and not to be advanced to a place, in which he knew, he could not anſwer the expectations, that ſome had of him: he wiſhed the Queen would ſeek out a Man, that were neither Arrogant, Faint-hearted, nor Covetous: and expreſſed the great apprehenſions he had, that ſome Men, who he perceived, were Men ſtill, notwithſtanding all the Trials they paſt through of late, would revive thoſe heats that were begun beyond Sea, and that they would fall a quarrelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, which would prove a pleaſant diverſion to the Papiſts. But when by many repeated commands, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to accept of that great advancement, he at laſt writ to the Queen her ſelf, and proteſted, <q rend="inline">that out of regard to God, and the good of her ſervice, he held himſelf bound in Conſcience, to declare to her, his great unworthineſs, for ſo high a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and ſo, as proſtrate at her feet, he begged her to preſs it on him no further: for that Office did require a Man of more
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:170737:359"/>Learning, Vertue and Experience, than he perfectly knew was in himſelf.</q> But as theſe denials, ſo earneſtly and frequently repeated, ſhewed, that he had certainly ſome of the neceſſary qualifications, which were true humility, and a contempt of the World; ſo they tended to increaſe the eſteem, which the Queen, and her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters had of him: And they perſiſting in their Reſolution, he was at laſt forced to yield to it. He was upon the ſending of the <hi>Conge d'eſlire,</hi> choſen by the Chapter of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury;</hi> and in <hi>September,</hi> the Queen iſſued out a Warrant for his Conſecration, which was directed to <hi>Tonſtall, Bourn</hi> and <hi>Pool</hi> (the laſt was Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi>'s Brother, and was Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough</hi>) and to <hi>Kitchin, Barlow</hi> and <hi>Scory:</hi> by which it appears, that there was then ſome hope of gaining the former three to obey the Laws, and to continue in their Sees: but they refuſing to execute this, there was a ſecond Warrant directed to <hi>Kitchin, Barlow, Scory</hi> and <hi>Coverdale,</hi> and to <hi>Bale,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> and two ſuffragan Biſhops to Conſecrate <hi>Parker:</hi> and on the 17th. of <hi>December,</hi> he was Conſecrated by four of theſe, according to the Book of Ordination, ſet out under King <hi>Edward,</hi> only the giving the Paſtoral Staff was now omitted.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Parker</hi> ordained <hi>Grindall</hi> for the See of <hi>London; Cox</hi> for <hi>Ely,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>All this is opened the more particularly,
<note place="margin">The Fable of the <hi>Naggs</hi>-head con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> for diſcovering the Impudence of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the <hi>Naggs</hi>-Head Ordination, which was firſt vented in King <hi>James</hi>'s time, above forty Years after this. It was then ſaid, that the Elect Biſhops met at the <hi>Naggs</hi> Head Tavern in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> and were in great diſorder, becauſe <hi>Kitchin</hi> refuſed to conſecrate them; upon which <hi>Scory</hi> made them all kneel down, and laid the Bible on their Heads, ſaying, <hi>Take thou Authority to Preach the Word of God ſincerely;</hi> and that this was all the Ordination that they ever had: and to confirm this, it was pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Neale,</hi> one of <hi>Bonner</hi>'s Chaplains, watched them into the Tavern, and ſaw all that was done through the Key-hole. This was given out, when all that were concerned in it were dead; yet the old Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> who had ſeen <hi>Parker</hi>'s Conſecration, was ſtill alive, and declared, that he ſaw it done at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:170737:360"/>according to the Common-Prayer-Book, and both the Records of the Crown, and the Regiſters of the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> do plainly confute this. The Author did alſo ſee the Original Inſtrument then made, deſcribing all the particulars relating to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>'s Conſecration, preſerved ſtill in <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> among the other Manuſcripts which he left to that Houſe, in which he had his Education.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that the Biſhops ſet about,
<note place="margin">The Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Church publiſhed.</note> was, the publiſhing the Doctrine of the Church. In order to this, a Review was made of thoſe Articles, that had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled under <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. and ſome ſmall alterations were made. The moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, was, that a long determination, that was made formerly againſt the Corporal Preſence, was now left out; and it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, <hi>That the Body of Chriſt was given and received in a ſpiritual manner, and that the means by which it was received, was Faith.</hi> Yet in the Original Subſcription of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, by both Houſes of Convocation, ſtill extant, there was a full declaration made againſt it, in theſe words, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he aſcended into Heaven, made his Body Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, but took not from it the nature of a Body. For ſtill it retains, according to the Scriptures, a true Humane Body, which muſt be always in one definite place, and cannot be ſpread into many, or all places at once: ſince then <hi>Chriſt</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up to Heaven, and is to remain there
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:170737:361"/>to the end of the World, and is to come from thence, and from no other place, to judge the Quick and the Dead; None of the Faithful ought to believe, or profeſs the Real, or as they call it, the Corporal Preſence of his Fleſh and Blood in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.</q> But the deſign of the Queen's Council, was, to unite once the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into the Communion of the Church; and it was feared, that ſo expreſs a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition againſt the Real Preſence, would have driven many out of the Communion of the Church, who might have been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe kept in it: and therefore it was thought enough to aſſert only the Spiritual Preſence, but that it was not neceſſary to condemn the Corporal Preſence, in ſuch expreſs words; and therefore, though the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had ſo poſitively determined this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was thought more conducing to the publick peace, to daſh it in the Original Copy, and to ſuppreſs it in the Printed Copies.</p>
               <p>The next thing they took in hand,
<note place="margin">A Tranfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bible.</note> was a new Tranſlation of the Bible: Several Books of it were given to ſeveral Biſhops, who were appointed to call for ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, as were learned in the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Tongues, and by their aſſiſtance they were to tranſlate that parcel that fell to their ſhare: and ſo when one had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated that which was aſſigned to him, he was to offer it to the Correction of thoſe that were appointed to tranſlate the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:170737:361"/>other parts, and after every Book had thus paſt the Cenſure of all, who were imployed in this matter, then it was approved of. And ſo great haſt made they in this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant work, that within two or three years, the whole Tranſlation was finiſhed.</p>
               <p>There was one thing yet wanting,
<note place="margin">The want of Church diſcipline.</note> to compleat the Reformation of this Church, which was the reſtoring a Primitive Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, againſt ſcandalous Perſons, the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the Government of the Church in Eccleſiaſtical hands, and the taking it out of Lay-hands, who have ſo long profaned it; and have expoſed the authority of the Church, and of the Cenſures of it, chiefly Excommunication to the contempt of the Nation, by which the reverence due to Holy things, is in ſo great a meaſure loſt, and the dreadfulleſt of all Cenſures, is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moſt ſcorned and deſpiſed. But upon what reaſons, it cannot be now known, this was not carried on with that Zeal; nor brought to that perfection that was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. The want of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, ſet on ſome to deviſe many new Platforms, for the adminiſtration of it, in every Pariſh; all which gave great offence to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and were ſo much oppoſed by it, that they came to nothing. Other differences were raiſed concerning the Veſtments of the Clergy, and ſome Factions growing up in the Court, theſe differences were height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by thoſe who intended to ſerve their own ends, by making the ſeveral Parties
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:170737:362"/>quarrel with ſo much animoſity, that it ſhould ſcarce be poſſible to reconcile them: Since that time, the fatal Diviſion of this Nation, into the Court and Country party, has been the chief occaſion of the growth, and continuance of thoſe differences; ſo that all the attempts which have been made by moderate Men to compoſe them, have proved ineffectual.</p>
               <p>At this time there was a great revolution of affairs in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> When there was a probability of bringing the Treaty of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi> to a good effect, the Cardinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> writ to his Siſter, the Queen Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to the Archbiſhop of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> and let them know the Reſolution that was taken, to extirpate Hereſie, and exhorted them to uſe their endeavours for that end. The Queen Regent ſaw, that by doing this, ſhe would not only break her faith to the Lords, who had hitherto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to her, upon the aſſurance ſhe gave them of her Protection, but that the Peace of <hi>Scotland</hi> would be endangered; for as their Party was ſtrong, ſo it was not to be doubted, but the Queen of <hi>England</hi> would ſupport them, and ſo ſhe was not eaſily brought to follow her Brother's cruel Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. But the Biſhops ſhut their eyes upon all dangers, and reſolved to ſtrike a terror into the People, by ſome ſevere Executions. They began with <hi>Walter Mell,</hi> an old inſirm Prieſt, who had preached in ſome places againſt many of the Opinions then recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:170737:362"/>he was particularly accuſed for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aſſerted the lawfulneſs of the Marriage of the Clergy, and for having condemned the Sacrifice of the Maſs and Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, with ſome other particulars, all which he confeſſed, and upon his refuſal to abjure them, he was condemned to be burnt. Yet ſo averſe were the People from thoſe Cruelties, that it was not eaſie to find any that would execute the Sentence: Nor would any do ſo much as ſell a Cord to tye him to the Stake, ſo that the Archbiſhop was forced to ſend for the Cords of his own Pavilion. The old Man expreſſed great firmneſs of mind, and ſuch chearfulneſs in his ſufferings, that the People were much affected at it: and this being every where looked on as a Prologue to greater ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that were to follow, the Nobility and Gentry began to conſider what was fit to be done. They had offered a Petition to the Queen Regent the laſt year, that the worſhip might be in the Vulgar Tongue, that the Communion might be given in both kinds, and that ſcandalous Prieſts might be turned out, and worthy Men be put in their places. The Queen Regent being unwilling to irritate ſo great a Party, before the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> was declared King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that they ſhould not be puniſhed for having their Prayers in the Vulgar Tongue. In Parliament, they moved for a Repeal of the Laws, for the Biſhops proceedings againſt Hereticks, and that nothing might be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hereſie, but that which was condemned
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:170737:363"/>by the Word of God; but the Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent told them, theſe things could not paſs, becauſe of the Oppoſition, which was made to them, by the Spiritual Eſtate; upon that they made a Proteſtation, that whereas they had modeſtly moved for a redreſs of abuſes, they were not to be blamed for the ill effects of rejecting their Petition, and the Violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that might follow.</p>
               <p>But when the Queen had gained her end, in relation to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> ſhe ordered a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be ſerved on all the Reformed Preachers: The Earl of <hi>Glencawn</hi> was, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, ſent to put her in mind of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer promiſes; ſhe anſwered him roughly, <q rend="inline">That maugre all that would take thoſe Mens part, they ſhould be baniſhed <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and added, that Princes were bound only to obſerve their promiſes, ſo far as they found it convenient for them to do it.</q> To this he replied, that if ſhe renounced her Promiſes, they would renounce their obedience to her.</p>
               <p>In St. <hi>Johnſtown,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is firſt ſet up in St. <hi>Johnſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town.</hi>
                  </note> that Party entred into the Churches, and had Sermons publickly in them. The Miniſters were coming from all parts, to appear on the 20th. of <hi>May,</hi> for to that day they had been cited; and great numbers came along with them. The Queen apprehending the ill effects of a great Confluence of People, ſent them word not to come, and upon this many went home again; yet upon their not appearance, they
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:170737:363"/>were all declared Rebels. This foul deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made many leave her, and go over to thoſe that were met at St. <hi>Johnſtown.</hi> And the heat of the People was raiſed to that pitch, that they broke in upon the Houſes of the Monks and Friars, and after they had diſtributed all that they found in them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that which the Monks conveyed away to the Poor, they pulled them down to the ground. This provoked the Queen ſo much, that ſhe reſolved to puniſh that Town, in a moſt exemplary manner: ſo ſhe gathered the <hi>French</hi> Souldiers together, with ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as would joyn with her: but the Earl of <hi>Glencairn</hi> gathered 2500. Men together, and with incredible haſt, he marched to that place, where there were now in all 7000. armed Men. This made the Queen afraid to engage with them; ſo an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made. An oblivion was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for all that was paſt; Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were referred to a Parliament, and the Queen was to be received into St. <hi>Johns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town,</hi> without carrying her <hi>Frenchmen</hi> with her: But ſhe carried them with her into the Town, and as ſhe put a Garriſon in it, ſo ſhe puniſhed many for what was paſt; and when her promiſes were objected to her, ſhe anſwered, <q rend="inline">Princes were not to be ſtrictly charged with their Promiſes, eſpecially when they were made to Hereticks; and that ſhe thought it no ſin to kill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them all, and then would excuſe it as well as could be, when it was done.</q> This tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Hearts of the whole Nation from
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:170737:364"/>her, and in many places they began to pull down Images, and to raſe Monaſteries. The Queen Regent repreſented this to the King of <hi>France,</hi> as done on deſign to ſhake off the <hi>French</hi> yoke, and deſired a great Force to reduce the Countrey. On the other hand, ſome were ſent over from the Lords, to give a true repreſentation of the matter, and to let him know, that an Oblivion for what was paſt, and the free Exerciſe of their Religion for the time to come, would give full ſatisfaction. The <hi>French</hi> King began now to apprehend, how great a charge the keeping that Kingdom in peace, was like to come to; and ſaw the danger of the <hi>Scots</hi> caſting themſelves into the Arms of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> therefore he ſent one, in whom the Conſtable put an entire confidence to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to bring him a true report of the ſtate of that matter, that was ſo variouſly repreſented: But before he could return, the King of <hi>France</hi> was dead, and the Conſtable was in diſgrace; and all affairs were put in the hands of the Brothers of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> ſo that all moderate Councils were now out of doors. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did ſo univerſally riſe againſt the Queen Regent, that ſhe was forced to retire to <hi>Dunbar</hi>-Caſtle: She was once willing to refer the whole matter to a Parliament: But 2000. Men coming over from <hi>France,</hi> and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances being ſent Her, of a greater Force to follow, ſhe took heart, and came and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified <hi>Leith,</hi> and again broke her laſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon which the Lords pretended,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:170737:364"/>that in their Queens Minority, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was chiefly in the States, and that the Regent was only the chief Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator, and accountable to them: ſo they reſolved to depoſe her from her Regency.</p>
               <p>They objected many Maleadminiſtrations to her,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Queen</hi> Regent is depoſed.</note> as her beginning a War in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and bringing in ſtrangers to ſubdue it, her embaſing the Coin, governing without conſent of the Nobility, &amp; breaking her Faith and Promiſes to them, upon which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that ſhe had fallen from her Regency, and ſuſpended her Power till the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.

The <hi>Scots,</hi> who had been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto animated, and ſecretly ſupplied with Money and Ammunition from <hi>England,</hi> were now forced to deſire the Queen of <hi>England</hi>'s aid more openly: and <hi>France</hi> was now like to be ſo much divided within it ſelf, that the Queen did not much apprehend a War with that Crown; ſo ſhe was more eaſily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to aſſiſt the <hi>Scots.</hi>

               <p>A Treaty was made between the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and the <hi>Scots:</hi> they promiſed to be the Queen's perpetual Allies, and that after the <hi>French</hi> were driven out of <hi>Scotland,</hi>

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:170737:365"/>before her Brother's bloody. Counſels had involved her in theſe laſt paſſages of her life, ſhe had been the moſt lamented and eſteemed Queen that had been in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for many Ages. Her own Inclinations were Juſt and Moderate; and ſhe often ſaid, that if her Counſels might take place, ſhe did not doubt, but ſhe ſhould bring all things again to perfect Tranquillity and Peace: Soon after a Peace was concluded, between <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> An Oblivion was granted for all that was paſt; The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> were to be ſent out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all other things were referred to a Parliament.

<note place="margin">A Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meets, and ſettles the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> all Acts for the former way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were repealed, and a confeſſion of Faith penned by <hi>Knox,</hi> afterwards inſerted among the Acts of Parliament, 1567. was confirmed. Theſe Acts were oppoſed only by three Temporal Lords, who ſaid, they would believe as their Fathers had done: but all the Spiritual Lords, both Biſhops, and Abbots, conſented to them; and they did dilapidate the Lands and Revenues of the Church in the ſtrangeſt manner, that was ever known: the Abbots converted their Abbies into Temporal Eſtates, and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:170737:366"/>the Biſhops, though they continued Papiſts ſtill, divided all their Lands among their Baſtards or Kindred; and procured confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of many of the Grants they gave from <hi>Rome:</hi> by which, that Church was ſo impoveriſhed, that if King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, had not with much zeal, and great endeavours, retrieved ſome part of the Ancient Revenues, and provided a conſiderable maintenance for the Inferiour Clergy, all the encouragements to Religion and Learning had been to ſuch a degree withdrawn, that Barbariſm muſt have again over-run that Kingdom. When theſe Acts thus agreed on in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were ſent over to <hi>France,</hi> they were reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great ſcorn; ſo that the <hi>Scots</hi> began to apprehend a new War: but <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond's death, ſoon after delivered them from all their fears: for their Queen having no more the ſupport of ſo great a Crown, was forced to return home, and govern in ſuch a manner, as that Nation was pleaſed to ſubmit to.</p>
               <p>Thus had the Queen of <hi>England</hi> divided <hi>Scotland</hi> from its ancient dependance on <hi>France,</hi>

                  </note> into whoſe hands the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of affairs was put, during <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the ſecond's ſhort Reign: It was preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the one hand, that the King was not of Age, till he was 22. and that during his Minority, the Princes of the Blood were to Govern by the Advice of the Courts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and the Aſſembly of Eſtates: On the other hand, it was ſaid, that the King might aſſume the Government, and Imploy whom he pleaſed at 14. A deſign was laid, in which many of both Religions concurred, for taking the Government out of the hands of the ſtrangers, and ſeiſing on the King's Perſon, but a Proteſtant, moved by a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Conſcience, diſcovered it. Upon this the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and many others, were ſeiſed on, and if the King had not died ſoon after, they had ſuffered for it. <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth ſucceeding, who was under Age, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> was declared Regent, but he, though before a Proteſtant, was drawn into the Papiſt Intereſt; and joyned himſelf with the Queen Mother, and the Conſtable. A ſevere Edict was made againſt the Proteſtants, but the Execution of it was like to raiſe great diſorders, ſo another was made in a great Aſſembly of many Princes of the Blood, Privy Councellours, and 8. Courts of Parliament, allowing the free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that Religion: yet after this, the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:170737:367"/>Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> reconciled himſelf to the Queen Mother, and they reſolved to break the Edict: ſo the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to paſs by a Meeting of Proteſtants, his Servants offered violence to them; from reproachful words, it went to the throwing of ſtones; by one of which the Duke was hurt: upon which his Servants killed 60. of the Proteſtants, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 200. and upon this the Edict was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where broken. It was ſaid, that the Regent's power did not extend ſo far, as that he could break ſo Publick an Edict, and that therefore it was lawful for the Proteſtants to defend themſelves. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſet himſelf at the Head of them, and the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> being killed ſoon after the breaking out of the War, he, as the firſt Prince of the Blood, that was of Age, ought to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Regent: ſo that the Proteſtants ſaid, their defending themſelves was not Rebellion, ſince they had both the Law and the firſt Prince of the Blood on their ſide. The Wars laſted near 30. Years, for in all that time, notwithſtanding ſome Intervals of Peace, the ſeeds of War were never ſo rooted out, but that they were ready to ſpring up, upon every new occaſion. In this the Queen Interpoſed, and ſupported the Proteſtant Party, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with Men, but oftner with Money, ſo that ſhe had near the half of that Kingdom depending on her.</p>

She reigned more abſolutely over the Hearts, than the Perſons of her Subjects. She al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways followed the true Intereſts of her People, and ſo found her Parliaments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to comply with her deſires, and to grant her Subſidies, as often as ſhe called for them: and as ſhe never
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:170737:368"/>asked them, but when the occaſion for them was viſible, ſo after they were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if the ſtate of her affairs changed ſo, that ſhe needed them not, ſhe readily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged them. <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> ſet many Engines on work, both againſt her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Government: but ſhe ſtill lived and triumphed. In the firſt ten Years of her Reign, the Papiſts were ſo Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, that there was no ſtir made about matters of Religion. Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth condemned the madneſs of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, in that high and provoking Meſſage, which he ſent her; and therefore he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted a reconciliation with her, at two ſeveral times: and offered, if ſhe would joyn her ſelf to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he would annul the ſentence againſt her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Marriage, and confirm the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſervice, and the Communion in both kinds. But ſhe refuſed to enter into any Treaty with him. <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, that ſucceeded him in that Chair, reſolved to contrive her death,
<note place="margin">Catena.</note> as is related by him, that writes his Life.

But her own officious friends, and the frequent Plots that were laid, for taking away the Queens life, brought on her the Calamities of a long Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, that ended in a Tragical death: which, though it was the greateſt blemiſh of this Reign, yet was made in ſome ſort
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:170737:368"/>juſtifiable, if not neceſſary, by the many Attempts that the Papiſts made on the Queen's Life: and by the Depoſition which Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth thundred out againſt Her; from which it was inferred, that as long as that Party had the hopes of ſuch a Succeſſor, the Queen's Life was not ſafe, nor her Government ſecure.</p>
               <p>This led her towards the end of her Reign,
<note place="margin">Severities againſt the Papiſts were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</note> to greater ſeverities againſt thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, of which a Copious Account is given by Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham,</hi> that was for ſo many Years imployed, either in foreign Embaſſies, or in the ſecrets of State at home; that none knew better than he did, the hidden ſprings that moved and directed all Her Councils. He writ a long Letter to a <hi>French</hi> man, giving him an account of all the ſeverities of the Queen's Government, both againſt Papiſts and Puritans.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of which is,
<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Fr. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham</hi>'s account of the ſteps in which ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</note> 
                  <q rend="inline">That the Queen laid down two Maximes of State; the one was not to force Conſciences, the other was not to let factious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces go unpuniſhed, becauſe they were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the pretences of Conſcience: At firſt, ſhe did not revive thoſe ſevere Laws paſt in her Father's time, by which the refuſal of the Oath of Supremacy was made Treaſon, but left her People to the freedom of their thoughts, and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:170737:369"/>made it only Penal to extol a foreign Juriſdiction: She alſo laid aſide the word <hi>Supream Head,</hi> and the refuſers of the Oath were only diſabled from holding Benefices, or Charges, during their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal. Upon <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth's Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating her, though the Rebellion in the North was chiefly occaſioned by that, ſhe only made a Law againſt the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, or publiſhing of Bulls; and the venting of <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s, or ſuch other Love-tokens, which were ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> on deſign to draw the Hearts of Her People from her, which were no Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of that Religion; ſo that this could hurt none of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. But when after the 20th. Year of her Reign, it appeared that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> deſigned to Invade her Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and that the Prieſts that were ſent over from the Seminaries beyond Sea, were generally employed to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Subjects in their Allegiance, by which, Treaſon was carried in the Clouds, and Infuſed ſecretly in Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; Then pecuniary Puniſhments were inflicted on ſuch as withdrew from the Church: and in Concluſion, ſhe was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make Laws of greater rigour, but did often mitigate the ſeverity of them, to all that would promiſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to her, in caſe of a Foreign Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. As for the Puritans, as long as they only inveighed againſt ſome abuſes, as
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170737:369"/>Pluralities, Non reſidence, or the like, it was not their Zeal againſt thoſe, but only their Violence that was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: When they refuſed to comply with ſome Ceremonies, and queſtioned the ſuperiority of Biſhops, and declared for a Democracy in the Church, they were connived at with great gentleneſs: But it was obſerved, that they affected Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity much, and the Methods they took to compaſs their ends, were judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dangerous, and they made ſuch uſe of the averſion the Nation had to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, that it was viſible they were in a hazzard of running from one Extream to another: They ſet up a New Model of Church-Diſcipline, which was like to prove no leſs dangerous to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of private Men, than to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power of the Prince: Yet all this was born with, as long as they proceeded with thoſe expreſſions of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which became Subjects. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when they reſolved to carry on their Deſigns, without waiting for the conſent of the Magiſtrate, and entred into Combinations; when they began to defame the Government by ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Paſquils, and boaſted of their Numbers and ſtrength, and in ſome Places brake out into Tumults, then it appeared that it was Faction, and not Zeal, that animated them. Upon that, the Queen found it neceſſary to reſtrain
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:170737:370"/>them, more than ſhe had done former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet ſhe did it with all the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that could conſiſt with the Peace of the Church and State.</q> And thus, from this Letter, an Idea of this whole Reign may be juſtly formed.</p>

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>Thus have I proſecuted, what I at firſt undertook, the Progreſs of the Reformation, from its firſt, and ſmall beginnings in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> till it came to a compleat ſettlement in the time of this Queen. Of whoſe Reign, if I have adventured to give an Account, it was not intended ſo much for a full Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of Her, and her Councils, as to ſet out the great, and viſible Bleſſings of God that attended on her; the many Preſervations ſhe had, and that by ſuch ſignal Diſcoveries, as both ſav'd her Life, and ſecured her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and the unuſual happineſs of her whole Reign, which raiſed Her to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, and envy of that Age, and the wonder of all Poſterity. It was wonderful indeed, that a Virgin Queen could rule ſuch a Kingdom, for above 44 Years, with ſuch conſtant ſuccefs, in ſo great Tranquillity at home, with a vaſt increaſe of Wealth, and with ſuch Glory abroad. All which may juſtly be eſteemed to have been the Rewards of Heaven, crowning that Reign with ſo much Honour and Triumph, that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with the Reformation of Religion.</p>
